The sight of religious priests and their acts sometime hold you back. So much money being offered and shown in front of the deity is an anachronistic feeling. What does currency notes have to do with the deity but people think differently. Priests and beggars pestering is an inconvenience one has to stoically but firmly bear.\\nGoing around the temple gives a good view of the temple structure, beautiful sculptures and religious fervour of the people. I deliberately avoided looking at the \\\"bali\\\" or sacrificial site, not convinced as to what killing of animals or birds has to do with religion and faith.

During Ambubachi (3-4 days period in June-July when mother goddess is said to menstruate) the temple is closed and there is a huge mela outside the temple. It is most auspicious to visit the temple immediately after it reopens after Ambubachi. So people from various states come to seek blessings and offer prayers during that period. During this period the queues of devotees can go upto several kilometers. So unless you are a devout devotee avoid going to the temple during this period. Ditto navratri period. Animal sacrifice is still practiced and there is a separate enclosure where the animal (goats, pigeons and even buffaloes) are slaughtered. It is advisable to avoid the said enclosure if you are weak hearted.\",\"Fortunately during my visit to Gauhati, on 31.7.16 I visited the temple..this is ancient place but astonished to see the dust on the fans and walls of the temple,it seems since a long dust have not been wiped, this leaves a bad impression on the pilgrims..temple committee should immediately pay attention..\",\"Know for historic connection with Ma Shakti.

A poor impression to anyone who is visiting this temple. basically if you have money you can buy your way in or else there is a huge queue that could end in 3 hours to reach the main temple. the pandits are just there to make money from the rich or needy people. the place was kept entirely dirty, and it was hard to walk. the approach filled with people sleeping on the road, eating, puking, drunks, smokers, and when you cross that place you coe to a array of shops that are meant to sell you the prasad, as per your budget. I am sure the gods must want tmove out from there.\",\"You can reach the temple by taxi, auto rickshaw or even public buses. For visiting the temple one can keep their shoes in one of the shops selling puja materials.Apart from general queue, there are paid queues also.Rs 501 and Rs 50 for Defence/paramilitary personnel. The waiting depends upon type of visitor. During Navaratras the the temple door opens at 9.00 AM otherwise at 8 AM.  There are many Pandas avilable if one wants to perform puja.

The temple and its surroundings were quite clean.\",\"We visited at 3 pm on VIP pass. Had less rush and was able to do darshan comparatively sooner than expected. Very neat and well maintained temple. Lots of Pujaris keep standing and asking you for accompanying you for puja, personally we didn't take any help of pujaris, felt it more of a business for them. Touch here, touch there, put money here and there... So it's your choice. The darshan was spell bounding, but it's very dark inside and last passage is quite narrow. So old people should take care.\",\"Went for a business trip to guwahati and after work got an opportunity to pay a visit to this highly acclaimed must visit place of guwahati. Well to begin with i reached at 4pm and the special/ paid darshan line closes at 4pm, so i requested a pujari on the main mandir exit gate to get inside the temple and he helped me get in, in exchange of 600rs. I was straight inside the temple premise and to my utter shock there are many pujaris inside the temple who will either put tika on your forehaid and ask for money or to even look at the goodess will ask for money, very upset. They either need to be paid by temple trust and place be better managed. Quick tip- my pujari was good who atleast allowed me inside temple , there are many who are fooling people by taking money and offering puja outside main temple premise so pls be advised.\\nHavent seen any provision for wheel chair and place is no for person with walk disabilities.\\nIt is worth to watch sunset from the altitude of the hill where temple is based. You may find cab services like ola/ uber, please note it takes good 20-30 mins or more for cabs to come till temple gate as its on the hill.\",\"We visited Kamakhya temple with 4 senior citizens ladies , one 3 year old kid.

We reached temple at 6 15 AM by Auto. Paltan Bazar to Temple fare is Rs 250. After reaching base of the temple, we need to climb stairs. My mother has serious knee issues, but even she was able to climb with little support. There are many shops to buy puja material, they will allow to keep shoes for free. As advised by our Panda, we climbed full with Shoes and then just before entering temple, we remove the shoes in a shop and purchased Puja items. It is purely based on personal wish.\\nWe entered inside temple. My wife went to VIP Darshan Queue where our names are already registered, she paid Rs 501 per head and collected the tickets. Till them I was managing kids and all senior citizens.\\nNext we entered VIP waiting hall. It is big room where lots of people are seating, Waiting time is around 2 hours in that hall seating comfortably under fan. And then once the Door open, one can complete Darshan in 10 minutes.\\nPls note if you have to use Washroom in this 2 hours while waiting in VIP waiting hall, it will be difficult as the Facility is not that great.\\n\\nOur Panda took us inside, did pooja, went inside Garbha Griha, had Darshan, touched the holy water. Pls be careful here inside Garbhagriha there is no light, fully dark and stairs are uneven. My mother was not able to fold her knee and seat on ground to touch water, it will be very difficult to seat and get up so fast, hardly in one minute you will be pushed out of temple.\\n\\nAfter coming out there will be many Pujaris asking to touch different idols for blessing, but as you touch immediately they will demand money. So pls be careful.\\n\\nWe came out of Mandir, did Pradakshina and collected Prasad and Holy water from our Panda. We paid him Dakshina..\\nNow photo time.. took lots of Photos, also we paid professional photographer to take some photos, they delivered in 5 minutes and Quality was good.\\nWhile climbing down, we purchased some gift items for our relatives, prices are very high, need to bargain.\\nAfter coming down, there are many hotels offering Breakfast service, we finished breakfast and then catch returned auto for Hotel (Rs 250 to Paltan Bazar)\\n\\nNote- Uber is very costly in city, and 99% they will ask you to cancel saying they are in opposite side etc.. Nothing is based on KM distance, all places have pre fixed rate for Auto, Cycle Rickshaw.\\nOverall very good experience even with Senior citizen and Kids we managed to have good Darshan. Thanks to our Panda Mr Bharat Sharma to make it happen and help in every step.\",\"It is a very holy temple for hindus.

The vendors outside the temple and the purohits  are extremely well behaved and there never is a craving for your money. Even if it time consuming, it is worth offering a prayer after standing in a big que. The charges are also nominal, they accept whatever is offered.\",\"Recently visited the temple during evening time. It's a big temple. It's same like other temple's much but you need a lot of patience to visit the place as it may take upto few hours in the queue. Moreover get into temple with your pockets full of 100's currency notes. Every pandit sitting over there on the sub temple's clearly demands of a 100 Rs note openly & you can't refuse it...

Many visitors to Guwahati make it a point to visit the temple to take Ma Kamakhya's blessings. Pre-paid taxi services, auto and government buses ply to and from the temple and the city at regular intervals. One visiting Kamakhya should also make it a point to visit the Bhubaneswar Temple situated on the top of the hill. Many couples get married at this place, and here the marriage ceremony is held both by performing the Hindu rituals as well as a marriage certificate is given.\",\"The visit to Guwahati is incomplete if one doesn't visit Kamakhya Temple. Its on the outskirt of the city on way to airport ! One can visit the deity as general visitor, where in the crowd is large and time taking ! else one can have get pass collected from counter @ 500 per person, children below 10yrs don't require any entry fee . Arrangements are quite well managed with comfortable seating arrangements for pass holders .\",\"I try to visit this Saktipeeth whenever i am at Guwahati. A lovely 20 min drive from the city centre , negotiating the steep curves of Nilachal hill you reach the abode of Goddess Kamakhya. Always take a panda after getting down the vehicle and keep all your valuables inside the vehicle. The Panda will arrange youe special Darshan Ticket ( 500 rs ) andguide you through the various temples and ultimately upto the sanctum sanctorium. One should not travel with infants, ventilation is not sufficient inside. But once you have the Darshan you will feel tranquility and hapiness. The view of the Gauhati town from the hilltop is breathtaking.\",\"One of the ancient temples known for its energy.lacs of people do gather on special occasion for prayer and worship.its must for praying Shakti.\",\"We kept this visit at the last day of our visit to Assam. It was a mistake;should have gone there on day 1. We expected to buy the VIP ticket the queue for which is much shorter but didn't know that the counter closes early. We had a flight in some time so couldn't reach the main temple. However we visited the temple of kamakhya behind the main temple, and even this temple was so powerful, I couldn't move for a good 10 min! It's amazing what one feels there. Also visited all the other temples in the compound but none of them cam close to the one. I cannot imagine what the main temple would be like; v unfortunate I couldn't visit.\\n\\nRemember to find out the time till when the VIP queue counter is open till. The other queue takes forever. keep a note of water. Keep your cab and driver with you as this temple is on the top of a hill. There are monkeys around. Goats can be seen tied everywhere for sacrifice.\",\"Awesome, Temple of lord Durgae................. They serve prasaad in Kheechiri which is really yummy and tasty...\",\"Situated at the heart of the city, it the must-go place for the residents as well as tourists.Hats off to the debutter board for the maintainence of such a huge temple .\",\"As there is a lot of reviews here I will just add few points:\\n\\n1. Please go as early as possible in the morning (before 4) be prepared to stand in the queue for several hours. OR you can opt to pay 501/- to get special Darshan.\\n\\n2. Also, visit 7 other temples nearby, which are also of powerful tantrik goddesses namely Bagalamukhi ma, Bhuvaneshwari ma, bhairavi ma, dhumavati ma, chhinnamasta ma, Tara ma and Kali ma. They are mapped on Google so you can find them easily.\",\"One of 18 shaktipeethas in India, Kamakhya is very powerful. We took a pundit with us inside the temple to help us guide inside. We first went to a pond inside temple whise water was from Brahmaputra river. As we entered the temple , we saw a huge statue of Kamakhya Devi but that was not main darshan. We had to go down the steps which was a very narrow way and very dark inside. That was the place with main statue in water. We drank some water , offered our prayers. We felt very Devine.\",\"The place is amazingly decorated and peaceful but you need to be careful of the time you reach the temple  for your Darshan. If you plan to visit the temple on specially on Navami an desire to go to another places the same day by even completing the darshan nicely then you might get into a problem. It will obviously take you upto 12-15 hours for your darshan in general queue (but not so long if you go with a special ticket with a fee for 501/- per head). So please mind this situation also before planning the trips further from Kamakhya. If you get there at 3 or 4 am in the morning then you can probably complete your darshan before noon.\",\"Overall this place is nice. One thing they should learn from Vaishno Devi is to organise and manage crowd both in queue and also when inside the main temple complex. Its dark inside the garbh grih and the space also is narrow. The flow of people is not managed at all, we have the pandas also pushing in. Proper management of crowd is required else it may lead to some major accidents some day\",\"Kamakhya Temple is on the top of Nilachal Hill, Guwahati. The roads are very good and the connectivity is also good by Bus, Cab etc.\\nThere is hotels for food, markets for purchasing anything and specially religious items.\",\"my experience to this auspicious place of devotion was excellent. Located on the Nilachal hill top, this place offers a breathtaking view of the hills and the Brahmaputra river from above. The temple as such is highly revered by all and has six goddess temples within the premises along with the main deity of \\\"Kamakhya\\\". Bags are not permitted within the main goddess temple perimeter and though there was a big queue to go close to the deity, \\\"Mukh Darshan\\\" or face view of the same was done with ease along with \\\"Abhishek\\\". A pundit for the same comes at a reasonable price of Rs.500/-. Along with the darshan of the Umananda temple I think a tourist has got the required devotion and mythology dose of Assam and Guwahati. Overall a great place to be.\",\"The temple stands for Goddess  Kamakhya and is popular among local folks as well as tourists. The environment is divine and you feel one more step closer to the God.\",\"Unlike other hindu temples the priests do not coerce for money.

The Goddess Kamakhya is worshipped in the sanctum sanctorium as a 'yoni' shaped rock in an underground cave below the temple, from which a perennial stream rises; there is no image of worship. The cave is narrow and only limited number of visitors can have 'Darshan', hence the maximum numbers are lead to the upper hall of the temple and shown a beautiful statue of the goddess which is reverred as the 'Dhyan -murti' or the form to be meditated on. However ,if one is intent of having a 'darshan' of the actual peetha, then one must arrive at the temple at sunrise and join an already serpentine queue on the right side of the temple. The gates of the underground shrine open after puja around 8am, and then the pilgrims proceed slowly into a narrow claustrophobic iron grilled enclosure (custom made for stampedes), winding at snails pace lower and lower , beyond ornate gates into a dark cave, lit by lamps where one can see the narrow rock pool with the flowing stream, which is worshipped as the living Goddess Kamakhya.2. Kameshwar/ Umananda Shiva is not to be seen on Nilachal hill, but resides instead in a little island on the Brahmaputra, known as Bhasmachal , where he is said to have burnt Kamdeva into ashes. The scenic river island can be seen from the Nilachal hill and small country boats ferry people across from the foot of Nilachal. Mind you, the pilgrimage to Kamakhya is considered incomplete unless you have worshipped her consort too at Bhasmachal.     Besides that the ancient temple complex has the usual attractions, sadhus, tantrics and yoginis with dreadlocks and trishuls of varying length and ferocity, shops selling 'Dakshinavarti shankas' and other esoteric goods used in Shakti and tantra worship, and many temples to the various aspects of the Goddess, some closed, some in use. The nature lover will enjoy the serpentine road climbing to the windy hilltop and the amazing views of the Brahmaputra,Guwahati and Saraighat bridge from there. History buffs can see many layers of architecture and styles, many statues some in worship , some defaced , a few half burried in the pavement.Unfortunately as a shrine in current worship not enough attention has been paid to preserve the ancient heritage during current rennovations.  While the Ambubachi festival is very famous , it is to be noted that the temple remains closed during the three days when the Goddess is said to be menstruating. Tantrics, yogis, bauls from all over gather in the temple yard and their songs, trances and dances gives the area a festive atmosphere. After the temple reopens, pieces of red cloth, said to have been steeped in the holy blood are distributed as 'prasad' and are valued as remedies and protection from various ills.\",\"Kamakhya is one of the 51 Satipith of maa Durga.

One has to get down at Kamakhya station/Guwahati station (both almost equidistant) and hire a bus/taxi/own vehicle to reach this temple. Two three things to keep in mind is as follows:\\n1) Plan early morning visit (5-5:30 am). Then one can finish the visit by 8am. (temple opens at 7am but queue starts from 4-4:30am). So no matter how early you come, you will get to see few people always in line before you.\\n2) If you have less time, ask for the ticket counter of Rs. 501/- and wait in different line (much much shorter): will finish darshan in 1 hour max.\\n3) Pandas don't force you for money (but still they ask for it) inside the main temple.\\n\\nTemple premise is good and clean (but once you enter, you have to rush towards the queue).\\n\\nTemple grabhgriha is dark and one need to go in and touch the water pit inside and then donate and come(as per wish).\\n\\nGovernment bus ply between kamakhya temple and city (cheapest mode).\",\"The temple is on a hill, if you are coming by your own car remember that there will be no parking for private cars on the hill. The highway has parking and you will have to keep this in mind. We reached the temple at 7 am. As is typical in temples there is ample confusion on what one is supposed to do. We got into two queues and by asking we realized these were for Defense Personnel. Realizing that the general queue was 3-4 hours long people waiting since 5 am. We paid 501 per person and got into VIP queue. This queue took us good 2 hours. It is best to avoid all pandits promising short-cuts nothing will work out. The queue moves slowly so it gives to ample time to thing about divinity, why they still have \\\"animal sacrifice\\\" and chant devi mantras. If you are lucky people will chant along and if you are unlucky you will watch people squabbling. We had mixed luck we watched both.\\nThe entry to garb grah is dark, dingy and has uneven steps. Many old uncles and aunties are making the darshanarthi and devi exasperate over general state of affairs. The best thing is you cannot blame anyone that is the way it is. Remember you are here to receive divine vibrations from the most revered tantrik temple. So why block your mind with negative thoughts when you are want to recieve positive vibrations.\\nI did receive the vibrations from all the animals who are going to be innocently killed for no fault of theirs so the devotee can receive the fruits of their sacrifice. In any case I am digressing.\\nMay devi bless you all!\",\"Kamakhya Temple is one of the three Shakthipeets in the North East (I think the other two are, as far as I know, the Durga Temple of Narthiang, near Jowai, Meghalaya and also the Tripuri temple in Tripura, Agartala). I have not visited Agartala so far but I have visited the Narthiang one, which is a small temple mainteined by a Bengali family and the temple comes alive specially on the Durga Puja days.\\nThe Kamakhya Temple is one of the oldest Durga temples in the North East and its location on the Nilachal Hill facing the mighty Brahmaputra river is significant. I have visited Kamakhya at least 4 or 5 times during the past 22 years of my stay in the North East. Initially when I was in Silchar teaching in Assam University, I heard from a Bengali friend about the religious significance of the temple and hence sought the help of my friends to visit the same. So, once, en route to our catching the train from Guwahati to Chennai we visited the temple. Of course since none except me was interested in visiting the temple shrine, I had to make it alone. I was caught by a Panda, who helped me to enter upto the shrine and see the Ma Durga.Howver it did not make an impact on me, since it is very different from the South Indian temples. I was more interested in the temple's that gave us an enchanting view of the great Brahmaputra River. We used to walk past the temple uphill to choose a quiet spot from which we could see the brimming silver waters of the river and the calm environ around.\\nThen sometimes to engage the visitors from the South we would take them to Kamakhya and which always proved to be a harrowing experience, especially if it was festival days or auspicious days. The best time to visit Kamakhya, I learnt then, is either early in the morning (before 8.30 am or late in the evening, say after 4.30 pm or 5, so that you don't need wait in the queue for a long time. In Tirupathi also the wait in the queue is longer, but you do not feel the experience harrowing, since there is so much architectural beauty that you watch. But in Kamakhya, most of the walls are dirty and not much maintenance is there. The priests can be nasty too if you do not hurry up and leave your prasad DOWN in the shrine and pull out your prasad too quickly.You will understand what I mean here when you visit. There is a belief that if you put your hand in and pull out flowers or anything as prasad from the waters in the shrine, will bring you good luck.\\nI never go near the Bali peet, an enclosure that you will see as you come around the temple, since I just hate the site of blood from the hens or goats, atc, which devotees offer. You can read more on this from Indira Goswami's story on Kamakhya.\\nWhat I love the most about the temple is the architecture of the building - the spiral kind of architecture, with greyish hue with doves all around was a scenic environment. They say here that a visit to the temple changes one's life. I do not whether it is true. But certainly it is worth a visit at least once.\",\"Very neat and clean and well managed. We did not faced any problem while offering our Puja. People are very co-operative and friendly.\",\"well being a Hindu and this temple being a Shaktipeeth , it would be insolent of me to review it . Can only comment on cleanliness : Great\",\"Visited this holy temple in Dec-17. This was my first visit to this temple. It is located in vicinity of Guwahati city. Though, share bus/car service is available from main city to this temple, but we decided to take app based cab to save time. Presently Guwahati city going through major development programme, so frequent traffic jam are usual these days. So, it\\u2019s recommended to take sufficient buffer time to deal with traffic jam. Further, the road to temple has many turns similar to any hilly road. Thus, necessary precaution is mandatory if anyone has motion sickness. Cab/car/bus is not allowed beyond parking place. Considering the number of devotees visiting this temple, I felt, parking place is not sufficient. Further, many bus are also using the same parking space which makes the place bit crowdy.\\n\\nIn our case, it tool around 45-50 min to reach the temple from Lachit Nagar, Guwahati. We released the cab at parking and proceed to temple by walk. It took 10 min to reach main entrance gate. In this road, Puja items and Prasad are available. Anyone could purchase Prasad (stating from Rs. 51) as per their wish. During this approach road, many priest (Panda) told that they would take us inside the temple in minimum time. However, we already contacted one priest from Guwahati, thus, for us this selection was not required.\\n\\nIn Kamakhya temple, there are there ques to enter into the main temple. 1) General entry which doesn\\u2019t required any entry fee 2) VIP entry which required entry fee of Rs. 500 per person and 3) Entry for Army personal. This temple used to be over crowed in Tuesday, Saturday, partly Sunday and any special occasion. There are instances, when after paying VIP entry fee, devotee waited 4-5 hrs in Que. Thus, anyone can imaging the time required in general ques in those days. So, for hassle free Puja, my recommendation is plan accordingly (is possible).\\n\\nWe visited this temple in Thursday, so our time consumption was half an hour from standing in que to completion of Puja. In that day, general que took only 1.5 hours for the same. Inside the temple, light is very low and we have to get down 15-20 stairs. Aged people are frequently visiting this temple, so safeguarding is must. Otherwise, they may get hurt. In front of Maa Kamakhya idol, other priests are already there for Puja. Then I realized that in this temple, \\u201cPanda service\\u201d is not mandatory which required additional expanse. Anyone could use the que and extend his/her puja without any Panda. In this temple, \\u201cKumari Puja\\u201d is also available. Generally newlywed couple are offering this puja.\\n\\nPost Puja, we took a quick tour of entire temple. Temple premise was very clean and work done by temple admiration is appreciable. After that we entered into Prasadalaya where free Prasad is available for all. It is located just beside the approach road to temple. Coupon is available at the entry gate and quality and quantity of food was very good. My recommendation is please have the Prasad during your visit.\\n\\nOverall, we were very satisfied and recommend all to visit this holy place.\",\"Like most of the religious places, you will find it crowded most of the time. The temple is open from sunrise to sunset, with a break from 1300 hrs to 1430 hrs. Be prepared to spend at least 3-4 hrs if you are in the regular queue, or at least an hour if you purchase a special pass costing 500/- per head (available from the temple office in the premises). One may choose to avail the services of a 'panda', who may charge extra, or just buy 'prasad' from the numerous shops on the way and have 'darshan' on your own. You can also stop at one of the eateries on the way to have snack, (I would recommend poori sabzi as it is the fastest running dish), if you are hungry!\\nImportant-The temple remains closed for 3 days during the 'Ambubachi Mela' held in the last week of June.

Early morning or late evening rides to the hill will mesmerize you considering the serene mist in midst of deciduous forests. Numerous yogis frequent this place in search of salvation from ancient to even now. You can feel something once you enter the sanctum of course with devotion. There are no idols inside. A natural spring flows perennially between two rocks which are drowned and moist. Legend says the water turns red during Ambugachi Mela (the deity mother actually goes through periods like human).\\nCommon queues takes long time for the darshan, but a Rs500 ticket can be a quick affair.

Reach there in morning to take the darshan through general queue. It takes 4-5 hours if you go by general queue. There is VIP line which costs 500rs but still takes 2 hours of standing in the queue. The temple closes for darshan at 1pm and opens back at 2.30 pm so plan to complete darshan before 1pm. Kindly note that the VIP passes are issued only till 11am and then again from 2.30pm. So if you reach between 11am to 2.30pm you have to either wait or take the third option of taking darshan through a Pandit. It costs around 700rs per head but you get direct darshan inside the temple and takes only half hour. If you are very short of time take this option. We took the third option as we reached late.

To get into the inside garba graha (sanctum sanctorum) there is a special ticket for 501/- INR. But even though the line is much shorter, the experience is humid, hot, sticky, chaotic. Pandits inside, jostle with each for one-upmanship.\\n\\nIn India, men don't normally have physical contact with women unknown/unrelated to them and this is very strictly upheld in temples. But here, I was routinely held at the shoulders and wrists by pandits supposedly trying to enforce discipline in the queue. It wasn't groping at all. But it made me very uncomfortable because I do not expect to be physically touched in this way inside a temple.\\n\\nIf you aren't a devotee, I'd advise you to just take a look from the outer gates and enjoy thye complex itself.\\n\\nPreferably visit in the morning, so the ground isn't too hot (as you have to enter barefoot)\",\"Very exciting compound of shrines, focussed on Kamakhya but incorporating Kali and others.

For the feeble hearted people, check and keep away from the extreme end opposite the entry, sometimes there are sacrifices of goats, etc.. not a very pleasant sight...some particular areas are not allowed to be photographed, so better to check before taking any photos..best time to visit would be Ambubachi Mela or festival which usually happens in June.\",\"The Kamakhya temple also known as Kamrup-Kamakhya is a Hindu temple dedicated to the mother goddess Kamakhya in Guwahati. It is one of the oldest and supposedly most powerful of the 51 Shakti Peethas. It is located on the Nilachal hill in the western part of Guwahati city of Assam state in India. Alongside the main Kamakhya devi temple, there are individual temples dedicated to the ten Mahavidyas - Kali, Tara, Sodashi, Bhuvaneshwari, Bhairavi, Chhinnamasta, Dhumavati, Bagalamukhi, Matangi and Kamala. Among these, Tripurasundari, Matangi and Kamala reside inside the main temple whereas the other seven reside in individual temples. It is an important pilgrimage destination for Hindus.\\n\\nThe current structure of the temple has been built and renovated many times in the period from 8th to the 17th century. The temple consists of four chambers: garbhagriha and three mandapas locally called calanta, pancharatna and natamandira aligned from east to west. The panels have delightful sculptured Ganesha and other Hindu gods and goddesses. Though the lower portion is of stone, the shikhara or the top is in the shape of a polygonal beehive-like dome and is made of brick.\\n\\nThere is a long queue of devotees always present at the temple and it can take a few hours for the darshan. However, they have a VIP queue where one can pay Rs.501 and get faster darshan. They also have a nice museum which has several exhibits which were used in the temple. There is a small water pon with fountains as well. There is a 25 feet odd deep sqaure pond under which there is a Shiva linga.\\n\\nOverall must visit place for tourists as well as worshippers of Hindu religion !!!\",\"Very much enjoyed visiting this temple which is one of the most important Shakti Peeth temples in India. It is a rather long queue to enter but you can pay extra for shorter VIP queue.

A beautiful wonderful temple, be it structurally or architecturally. A holy place, definitely meant for a profound peaceful prayer for those God seekers. It has got to be but it was never to be, became the last straw for us to conclude not to visit nor offer prayers at temples again! Some might argue it\\u2019s one off but it\\u2019s a bitter pill to swallow, the experience was too bad. Very bad indeed.\\nAs we wanted to visit and obviously offer prayers at the temple, we went as early as 4.30am. Queued to get the special pass, though had to wait but happy as I was the second in line. However, just when the counter opened , the priests the elderly ones were willing to cut queue to get special passes for those willing to part with a few rupees. Cut queue they did. I was number 9 or 10 by then.\\nOther inconsiderate ones placed their family members at the entrance gate, blocked of the passage way and went over to get the tickets. Those with tickets had to wait, haggle, squeeze and in the process the weaker ones pushed way back further behind. We had to push through which was next to impossible. Somehow managed to. Pity my wife and my 13 year old daughter.\\n\\nThen on entry we thought we could perform our prayer peacefully. But no, was not possible. Every priest stuck to their chosen visitors like a leech would and seemed to do archanai, at every deity.\\nOn top of that other priests waited with their yellow cloth spread at every corner forcing us to perform a prayer as they instructed and money was required to be given. Expected minimum RS100. Crazy! INR 20 not welcomed!\\nWhen we do not we were scolded. Luckily I do not understand Hindi! How do one say their prayer in this circumstances - absence of peace of mind.\\nFinally we were out some 45 minutes later. Once out the priest who stuck to us like a leech asked for INR 2500. Not only is but another couple of families. When I refused one can imagine the ugly scene that would follow. Beyond explanation.\\n\\nTemple is beautiful, very suitable for a outing with family. Excellent place of religion but than it\\u2019s the human factor that makes it difficult.\\n\\nPrayers are difficult to perform for the simple reason of money vs peace of mind.\\n\\nOne should visit but just be vigilant and don\\u2019t fall prey to anyone imposters there especially the priests.\",\"Liked everything about Kamakhya ... its so Divine !\\n\\nWell connected by Rail / Road / Air.

I reached there at 5.00 p.m. I was being told that darshan que is closed. It was last Navratra on that day. I was being told to come on next day early morning for darshan. I reached at 6.00 a.m and stood in que with my family. By 12.30 p.m. I found there was no chance of any darshan because que was not at all moving. I came out of que to bring some eatables for my kids. Then I came to know the real cause of delay in darshan. There was hardly any system followed for Darshan of general que. Temple Pandas were taking the people from back gate for darshan (may be after getting some extra amount). I guess there were hardly 2 to 3 thousand people in the que and if systematically darshana were performed, hardly it would have taken 2 to 3 hours to clear the line. But it was not done deliberately to create the panic among devotees so that they could be forced to pay some amount for darshana.\\nThe Kamakhya temple is a most powerful shakti peeth of India. I wonder how Govt. & local admin can leave the devotees coming from all the parts of world on the mercy of Pandas inside the temple and got exploited by them. Why not State Govt. undertake the administration of this temple so that there may be transparent system of darshan be followed like other temples.\",\"I love this spiritual place where you can explore the religious and cultural activities simontensouly.

Along with main temple, visit 7 other temples nearby, which are also of powerful tantrik goddesses namely Bagalamukhi ma, Bhuvaneshwari ma, bhairavi ma, dhumavati ma, chhinnamasta ma, Tara ma and Kali ma. All are mapped on Google so you can find them easily.\",\"It was a nice experience. Although there is an advantage for visitors with more money for the tickets, this is a place one should visit if he/she is in North east.

Even the VIP ticket holders need to wait hours to enter the complex so we decided to do Mukh Darshan only. We kept our shoes at a stall that was very close to the temple and also took offerings which were of very good quality from the same shop. Then once we entered we took the services of a pandit inside the complex who helped us in understanding where and how to do the puja as well as offered our items to the deity on the garbgriha on our behalf. There were lots of diyas lit and coconuts being broken at designated places along with cattle available for bali. There are pigeons as well available whom people bought and then freed from cages.\\nThe temple premises were very beautifully decorated for Navratri and the temple is unique. Along with that it\\u2019s location on a hill also makes the queue look invisible but the locals will tell you how long it is.

A must visit place . It is now widely being promoted as the place to be more so during the AMBUBACHI Mela. During this time, the doors of the temple are closed for between 4-5 days . Once the period is over, the entire complex is cleaned,  doors opened and Pujas offered. The  experience is mesmerising. The crowd gathered is huge and ranges from the Sadhus, Travellers and Aam aadmi. There is a que of VIP visitors too to seek the Mother's blessings. It is regarded as a Jagrata Deity. Prayers are answered when one offers them with devotion. Besides its spiritual  background, the story of the temple is incomplete  with a mention of the  myth/history  assocouated with it. How Narakasura tried to construct all the steps in one night. That path is still there anfd many ardent devotees take that to climb instead of the motorable roads. The Water tank inside the temple complex was built during the Ahom rulers time. Most of the structures are historic and date many centuries back. The temple structures are also an archaelogists' dream. There is a thriving community of people who reside in the hilltop and who were initially associated with the affairs of the temple in different capacities. Further up, the view is fantastic.

Garbh gruhey is the place where admist of total darkness you will find a small water body and one or two pujaries. This water is holy and it symbolizes maa sakti, no other statue. You will not find such a thing in many places. This is it's purity. Like water which is shapeless and colourless, this divine power will enter you and take whatever shape and colour you worshipped it with- no statue. It's amazing to find such a thing in a country where 33crore idols are worshipped.Queueless entry will only take you to the middle sanctum. But I will suggest you to line up early in the morning or in the other half of the day as the temple remains closed for nearly 2hrs and reopens at around 3 o'clock or so if I'm not mistaken and again closes in evening around 5.\\nYou can also taste delicious khichdi & kheer served outside free of cost after taking a token.

The temple area was quite clean.There are separate designated places for diyas and incense sticks and nothing except flowers are allowed inside the main temple. The main temple is small and especially the shakti peeth area is very dark, so be careful. The pandits sitting at the Shakti peeth do ask for dakshina.\\nPost visit we had prasad/bhog just outside the temple. The arrangement was fantastic, there is waiting area with enough chairs where you can keep shoes, and they give free tokens for bhog. They also manage the crowd well by letting in only a group of 30-40 ppl at a time. Very clean plates, food served is delicious and separate areas for ladies to sit and men to stand and have lunch.\\nVisit early to avoid rush, Uber is easily available to and fro this temple and hence better not to book a cab for entire visit.

A variety of people from all over India, mumbling and at times muttering in a variety of language. Wet floor. Smoke and the fragrance of the incense sticks in the air and sight of young, innocent goats ready to be sacrificed and offered to the deity; clamouring of the temple bells evoked a concoction of positive and negative thoughts, at times questioning why do we do what we do here and how different is this world from the my world which mostly confines to digital screens and office cubicles, and does it all matter? Reaching Maa and finally get her darshan is a journey of such random thoughts and observations. As the darshan to the deity neared, the mind chose to believe in all the legends and started to flip a plethora of unfulfilled desires and wishes so that it can present the one which is most wanted and desired to Maa so that it can be realized.

Mataji calling, I loved it.\",\"This place is considered one of the most holy temples in India. Thousands of devotee flock the temple each day to offer their prayers. The number is really astonishing. There are three ways to visit the deity, each line having separate tickets costing Rs 50, 100 and 500 respectively. I am not sure whether there is another ticket costing more than Rs 500. The number of people and thus the waiting time in each queue is inversely proportional to the ticket cost, ie. if you have Rs 500 ticket you get to enter the Garbhagriha and offer your Puja much earlier along with less number of people than if you choose Rs 100 line. So, be prepared to shell out a hefty sum of money if you are not willing to stand in queue for the whole day. Literally even in off-season, it may take 5-6 hours to complete your 'Darshan'. The main room where the deity is kept (Garbhagriha) has very narrow rim of area surrounding a centrally placed idol...some people are allowed to enter at a time and the rest in queue wait outside. Those who enters inside are again made to follow many queue which goes in serpentine fashion and encircles the room twice or thrice before reaching near the deity. It is dangerous to have two or three queues of men and women side by side in the narrow alley of a space of 'garbhagriha' as anytime a stampede may result. There are insufficient lights and no cross ventilation inside the main temple. The queue for Rs 100 and 50 wait in narrow enclosed corridors with the end of such corridor kept close with collapsible gate. If someone gets ill while waiting turn in the middle of the queue then its very difficult to extract him/her. The surrounding are not very clean. The Pandas (priests) occasionally hurl abuses if someone gives small amount of 'Pranami' or payment for their worship (which is again not fixed). If you can arrange a VIP pass then everything becomes super-easy. The whole system of getting the blessings of God is controlled by money and power, like every other big temple in India. But despite the huge earnings each day, no steps are taken to make the 'Garbhagriha' or main temple room safe and spacious.\",\"Mother is always a protector of every child.

Even many people we met at Guwahati told how much time they have to spend due to crowds. Wonderful experience.\",\"This is a very crowded place.  Just like in all temples you will have to take your shoes off.  We left our socks on and some of the locals were not happy about that.Worth visiting if you have not seen any other temples.\",\"Must visit before leaving Guwahati.

Many pilgrims, busting place. Singers, beggars, priests -- the whole big show! A must-see for sure\",\"Before going there I had no idea about religious prominence of the place. It is one of 4 shaktipeeths of maa Durga is country..be prepared to wait couple of hours in queue on no rush days with special 500 rupees ticket. Free entrance will take much more longer. Pandas fool people by showing temple from outside claiming they have helped jump the queue\",\"Very old  temple, a tantrapitha known for its  beauty and  popularity.The main yoni sculpture  is  actually situated  in one  corner  of  the  temple .So one has to go  in a queue for the revered  darshan.The sculpture is consists of a yoni shaped structure with a underground spring at its cleft.\",\"If you have planned to go, car Temple then you have to be prepared to get in the queue for and Q over an hour maybe three or four hours to get in the temple and the experience was too good.\\nIf you go on Guwahati and never visited then ur trip isn't complete , Kamakhya temple is a must go place\",\"The temple is situated on the Nilachal hill.The temple is a big one and crowded most of the time. We have to walk a little distance from the car park. There is usually a long queue for darshan, but we purchased a 501/- Rs ticket which allowed us to get in a shorter queue line.\\nThe temple is a old one and many practice animal sacrifice in the temple. It is done openly, so take care if you are sensitive towards such issues.\\nThere are clean washrooms and toilets which are free to use and shops just outside the temple. Also there are three more temples situated on the hill. Viewpoints located on the hill gives good view of the Guwahati city. Local buses also ply to the temple from the central bus stand.\",\"One of the 51 Shaktipeets and considered as one of the 3 ADI shaktipeeth and a most holy place for Hindus.\\nManagement needs to be changed as now it is run by bunch of priests who take people in directly for a price and make them do unnecessary pujas and hold the queue up for people who are actually standing in the queue for hours.\\nThe temple opens at 8 but people wait in general queue from 5. There is a defence queue and a vip queue which costs 500 per head.

Reason why people come there inspite of all the hurdles I guess\",\"The Kamakhya temple is one the oldest and most famous temples in the North-Eastern part of India and is a must visit for all visitors to Guwahati. The temple is on the top of a mountain and visitors may chose to climb to the top. But as for most visitors, I took a car ride to the top. These is an excellent paid car-park from where you need to walk half a kilometer to reach the temple. You need to climb to the temple and elderly should be careful since the cemented steps be become slippery due to water. There is some level of security at the entrance & visitors are not allowed to carry any leather items of wear footwear. The temple inside is large and dimly lit. The visit should be planned carefully with consultations or else one may land up waiting in queues for hours. Of course, visitors may choose to opt for VIP entrance for a fee (with receipt) but even then you may have to wait half an hour. If you land up early in the morning or late in the afternoon, the crowd may be thinner. I notice many sadhus lounging around on the premises and was reminded of Mr. Kushwant Singh's stories on \\\"yogis\\\" in the temple. The garbhagriha (Central Area) has water (I was left wonder how the water reached here on the top of the mountain) and one get a short opportunity to touch the deity (I could not see much).. There are some other \\\"Gods\\\" in the two outer chambers. After a parikrama around the temple, I walked down to our taxi. I noticed that many visitors were having puri-sabji in the restaurant near the car park but decided to avoid that. I was amazed at the water flowing in the temple at such height and the devotion of the people who were willing to spend so much time to just pray for a few minutes. The overall arrangements were very good but the prient kept demanding \\\"contributions\\\" even after I came out and that left a mark. This temple is definitely a must visit if you are in Guwahati but I would recommend a visit to the Umananda Temple for feeling closer to God.\",\"Almost 500-700 meter walk is there to reach the temple and throughout the walkway are shops.

We hired an Ola (Mini) and paid Rs.170/- to reach the temple and had to pay Rs.130/- while returning to hotel (Ola Micro).  As expected, it\\u2019s a divine experience to be there and to take part in offering Puja to God.  Since it was during the Puja days, the temple area was over crowded.  Somehow, we managed to reach everywhere barring the main \\u201carea\\u201d, since; the main door was closed much before we reached the temple.  Thus, try to avoid those Durga Puja days to be here.  However, we still had a great experience of having a divinely ambience there amidst burning lamp and incense sticks.

I understand there are special priced tickets for Rs 500 wherein you can have darshan a bit fast.\\n\\nI may not go back to this place again as the attitude of priests there repulsed me. I have never seen such open demand for money anywhere else in India.

So we had to take help of taxis, which were also not available round the clock. Have seen some things which I thought would never see.

Very lively and gotta admit the energy driving us when we were on the hill. Above all, according to Hindu scriptures, Goddess Sati's sex organs fell on this place when Siva carried her immolated body. Read the story before you go for comprehending the power of this place. This is considered the most important Shakti peetha of all. The darshan on a regular day would take nearly 3 hours.

Proper planning will help you to have early dharshan.  You are permitted to carry your mobiles and cameras with you.  But if the bags are bigger they do not allow and you may have to keep the bags with a private  vendor close to the entrance.  But your bag is kept openly and you have to be I've them.  Avoid carrying big bags unless there is no other alternative when you visit the temple.\",\"I have visited many Shakti peeths and this one seems to be most ancient one. Inside the temple one can see black stone walls with carvings of gods and goddess. Usually there is less rush on weekends during afternoon but avoid aarti time near 3:30 pm. As sunset is very early in this zone so temple closes at around 6pm in winters but it starts early morning. There is no forceful demand of \\\"daan\\\" by pandits here. Inside the 'garbhgrih' of temple, there is deep dark place which is actual worshiping place of Goddess Kamakhya. It's famous for 'tantrik' rituals as well.

We had to go back again before 1:30 PM to stand in the line for these tickets. There is no orderly system there and the counters opened only at 3 PM. The staff manning this are extremely rude and in connivance with the temple staff, even offered immediate dharshan for a bribe.There is no online orderly system for paid dharshan , as practised in Tirupati.I felt that a whole day was wasted, there are no good places around to eat and better pack some snacks or drinks before embarking on this visit.\\nEven though animal sacrifices banned in the country, this is one temple, where it still goes on.\",\"I visited this holy temple along with my three friends when we were visiting north east of India.

Of all the temples I visited in the city Kamakhya was easily the most beautiful in terms of Sculptures and Construction. The history (or \\\"mythology\\\" for any skeptics) behind the temple deity is that when Sati was humiliated by her father Dakshin she jumped into the Yagnya's fire and  her body parts scattered across the world. The part that fell here were her Genitalia parts hence the name \\\"Kama - Akhya\\\".

ola/uber to reach  this place, its on the mountain. Take VIP pass, its cheap. Normally people go in the morning, we went in the evening and just reached on time, the mandir is closed in the evening, but still you can take mukh darshan, if you miss the deadline in the evening\",\"This ancient temple is ideal for devotees. Only thing is the general queue is too long and it may take hours to have darshan. It is specifically difficult for people visiting with children. One may  choose vip option at a premium price for quicker darshan. Pandits perform the Pooja and brief about the temple. The temple has a lot of positive energy.\",\"Awsum feeling.\\n\\nTry VIP darshan after 3 pm as lines are very long. The feeling of darshan of Garbh Griha is beyond words\",\"Amazing temple ! Great feeling to be there . Need to get the tickets for quicker Darshan . Very clean and well\\nmaintained. Takes time to reach from the airport as there is construction work on the way . Parking to temple entrance is a little distance.\",\"First time visit with family. Temple is quite close to city, very well managed and kept clean. VIP darshan(Rs500/adult none for child) was over within 1 hour. Place is supercharged with energy of particular type. Would suggest to sit with closed eyes on periphary sitouts  to feel reverbrations. Must visit!!\",\"The shrine is well maintained, has a locker room,easy shoe deposit, crowds throng this temple, timings are morning 8:30am to 1:30pm then from 3 to 5pm, they have most details on site. The general que is very long so start very early by 530 am then you can have the darshan's in 2 hours, else there is an option of VIP darshan which costs Rs500, but they close it down at will depending on the crowds.this normally takes 1\\n-2 hours or more depending on the rush. The public transport system here is virtually non ex6, Uber/Ola will drop you but you have to be really lucky to get one back to take you downhill.the auto rickshaws Wallas are a moody lot, so can't be relied upon as there moods swing is based on where you wanna go, some shared Maruti van taxis can be available, they can be hired as full taxi also, but be prepared to shell out almost double of what it would cost you on an Ola or Uber.\",\"One of the oldest and famous temples of North East India of Goddess Durga with a unique history .  Visited the temple during the peak Dushera season; however the crowd was very well controlled.  You can buy a special ticket for visit in case you are short of time.  There are many halls for the visitors as they pass through the queue and the devotees move with patience.  They are served water from outside by volunteers.  The Guards are strict and control the crowd well to make the Darshan convenient despite the rush.  This is perhaps one of the few temples where you can remain in the Sanctum Sanctorum for about an hour as you move and you can have a memorable darshan.\",\"This is one of the shatipeeth of goddess. Very nice temple, it is normally very crowded every day. There is facility of special darshan on the donation of Rs 500/-, but it also take around three hours. Very calm and devotional place. Good arrangements by the authourities.\",\"So, I am rating this so low because i dont belive in the concept for waiting 6 hours for God almighty to bless me. I really do carve a way for own self in life. But it quite stupid to even do the VIP thing her as you PAY 500 and still stay in a queue for 2 to 3 hour. BTW do the mukh Darshan its takes about 15 minutes and its like you are almost there. Worked for me but for those who want to touch the Mata and feel they have achieved greatness 6 hours is the way to go!!! My feeling aside some of the best architecture and a well mainted temple in the north east\",\"One of the Shakti Peet, a very unique temple that I have visited, reached early morning 7 am on Tuesday morning, but the General Queue was already full, took the VIP pass for Rs. 501, still had to wait for close to 2.30 hrs to finish the Darshan,\\nThe queue moves very slow here as the Pandas(priests) inside the temple try to help the devotees to offer their prayers and in turn expect some monetary benefits.\\nThe Average time spent by the Devotee in side the temple is more here, so people like me coming from South India after visiting temples like Tirumala or Dharmasthalla should not get confused with the queue length and assume the Darshan will finish quick.\",\"If you are hard pressed for time, you can take the special darshan (it cost about Rs 500 per person). As we had time on hand and faith in our hearts, we took the longer version. We were in the queue for 7 hrs before we got darshan. Totally worth it.\",\"The cab drives you till almost the entrance. The lane towards the main gate is lined with shops selling goods for pleasing the Goddesses inside . From lotus flowers to red clothes to vermilion to garlands . Once you enter the main gate there is a wait for about half an hour just to buy VIP tickets that cost 501 / - Rupees . The VIP line is just a little shorter than the normal line of devotees. It took us another hour of standing in the Q for the Darshan's .\\nThere is a lot of chaos and pushing and tiresomeness to reach the main temple . the main temple is dark and unkept. The main mandir which is lower than ground level is even darker and not lit at all except the diyas in front of the deities.People push and show impatience . One wrong step and it could easily lead to a stampede.\\nPandits openly call out for donations . Many pandits roam around cursing people who dod not pay up when asked for donation .\\nOverall very sad state of affairs. The management seems to be just watching blindly and not really doing anything at all either about the upkeep or about the greedy pandits .\",\"I visited temple. I enjoyed greatly.\\nThere was big que for Darshan. I went through gate no 2 and did Darshan from a distance but it was wonderful experience. There was clear Darshan and I chanted Om Shivay Namaha. I met few Poojary and talked to them. I took good photos of Temple. I recommend to visit this temple.\\nDr Rohit Mody.\",\"The temple is mostly crowded. You can do darshan of idol quickly but there is long queue of 5-6 hours to enter garbhgriha to touch holy water. There are VIP tickets but that also gets sold fast and still has a queue of 2 hours. We did idol darshan in 30 min of queue. The waiting in queue was bit stressful for my daughters as we have never seen temple where the animals are sacrificed. There were small goats and pigeons with tilak who were brought in and would be sacrificed later. That was bit in nerving. The darshan was divine although.  I forgot all about queue and stress the moment we were in front of idol.\",\"It was a flawless Darshan, with a bit of waiting. The Pandits there were very helpful and decent. Felt blessed.\",\"The temple is of medium size and very old. It is visited to have darshan of one of avataar of Maa Durga.\",\"It is not an architectural marvel like many other temples of South and Central India . But it has an aura and a positive vibration hardly to match any where else. That the temple follows the Tantric sect ideas may dissuade certain puritans but believe me it has a great charm of its own. The cave or the Gupha where the private parts of Devi Parvati is supposed to have fallen doesn\\u2019t have any idol. The holy water there represents the Goddess and the Darshan in the general queue ight take as long as 3 to 4 hours on a normal day. The 501 rupees VIP tickets are issued only till the three special waiting halls fill up. It starts around 6.30 am and gets over within an hour on special days and might be available for another hour or two on lean days. However one can have Darshan of the Goddess idol in the shrine right above the Gupha within an hour and it is free. But take the help of a Pandit so that you get good Darshan and get to know the history of the place. He will get you the Tirtha (holy water) from the cave too. The Dakshina you give will help him financially and your soul will get \\u2018Aatma Santosh \\u2018. Enjoy a stroll around the temple which is kept very clean and do peep into the various shops around to get a feel of the place. Eat \\u2018Amara\\u2019 fruit ( appears to be a distant cousin of Aam) and cucumber with salt and mirchi. Soak in the atmosphere of great belief of the visitors there. You will return happily satisfied.\",\"The goodes has to call you . Then only you can go there .\\nBeautiful place.\\nBhakti will be attained once you go to temple .\\nYou have to go to the hilltop by road. You can buy a ticket for early Darshana.still with the ticket also we took almost 100 mins for completing the Darshana .\\nU have queues to go inside the temple and the lines move without any problem or jostling.\",\"We went for Darshan in the Month of Nov-2017 in the early hours.We reached at around 0600 am and waited in the queue , the door opens up at 0700 hrs .It took us around 06 hrs in the queue.Their is a special queue if some one wants quick darshan for R/s 501.The management of crowd is very well.\",\"Situated on top of a hill, the temple  is peaceful, clean and well maintained. It will take at least half a day at the temple (on ordinary days, not sure how it is during festivals) as there are long queues for the darshan.\",\"Just come and rise in love with the temple. If u r blessed then you may have to wait for a longer period  for a DARSHAN as you ca stay in her campus for a longer duration...\",\"Really the temple is so peaceful inside, and crowd is always in que for minimum 4 hours. So plan accordingly. But only a bad thing is some devotees inside the temple are so much money minded and they are spoiling the pilgrims devotional time. Darshan gave me a good devotion here.\",\"Take enough time in hand as darshan may take time or if you can afford go for vip entry for a out of line darshan\",\"Visited holy temple, people are cooperative, for normal visit it takes 7-8 hours, we took Rs. 500 VIP entry and did darshan in less than 1 hour.\",\"Had darshan of Kamakhya Devi temple. Better to go in the morning time. If you have less time go for VIP Darshan which normally takes 3 hours. Free darshan takes longer around 5 hours or so.\",\"Great history and powerful temple . It is strongly suggested that you get the Rs. 500/- tickets for the darshan, the other queue was pretty long and would cut into hours into your travel time,\\nBe careful of lot of people around to make money...\",\"Well renowned temple at hill top but always crowdy. However if you want only Darswan then can do it within less time. For touching the idols you need to wait in que for 3/4 hours.\",\"With greatest level of respect to the goddess and with no intention of making any comments on it, I'm writing a review on only the surrounding. This place is over crowded, at least a queue of four to five hours to take the darshan. Super unclean place as there're dead rotten birds here and there. The temple closes at around 5 in the evening so we don't really get time to plan the day. Parking around the temple is a big problem too.\",\"This is a place of great religious significance so attracts multitudes of devotees. Temple authorities have done well to put in place a reasonably efficient crowd management system.\\nTook us about 3 hours to complete the darshan with the special entry ticket (Rs501 per person) since it was a public holiday.\",\"This is one of the most famous temple in the city. There are many other temples in the premises in addition to Kamakhya temple. Due to heavy crowd, we couldn't do darshan (even though it was weekday). I suggest to visit in early morning to avoid crowd. Many people say this and Umananda temple are not to be missed temples when you are in the city.\",\"It is divine place with divine energy. Cleanness and decent behaviours of Pujaris are plus point. Extreme crowd is negative.Be ready to spare 5-6 hours for Darshan. It would be wise to go to temple in the evening to escape from the rush.\",\"Must visit place. Pls note for special line  ticket is available only at 6 30 to 7 am in morning and 2 pm in noon. We missed this so could only do darshan from outside with the help of pundit who usually charges 200 - 300 for this.

This is not like a traditional temple with an idol / deity in the sanctum sanctorum. We were fortunate to visit during the Dussehra. We took the Rs. 500 pass and could get the darshan in about 2 hours; we came to know that general darshan would take around 6-7 hours ! Read the history about this temple, the sacrifices made during, etc. from wikipedia - this will help you understand and connect better.\",\"Had the opportunity to have the Darshan at Ma Kamakhya Devi temple. There is a VIP line for Rs 501 however the waiting is more than 1.5 hours in the queue, with no provision to go for washroom. It could be made better like Vaishnodevi where the line keeps moving. The management can improve. The Darshan were fantastic and felt Blessed. A must visit for all, located on hill top.\",\"Reached here by a local bus from kamakhya junction railway station, crowd was heavy ,i got the darshan in 2.5 hrs ,deity is excellent, don't miss it\",\"Be safe from the local pandits etc. go their anytime you will find a long queue min 2-3 hours for darshan.\",\"The temple was extremenly crowded and there was a long queue. I had a flight to catch in 5 hours. Fortunately I learnt that there was a separate queue for which one had to pay Rs. 500 ticket. I took that ticket and I was done with the darshan in 45 minutes. I saw some people with pigeons and sheep. I hope they were not being sacrificed in the temple. The temple represents fertility aspect of Mother and is frequented by thousands of pilgrims. As is usual with all the shaktipeeths, the management is messy but it was far better than a Tarapeeth or Kalighat.\",\"Nice experience to visit the temple. Although the VIP pass was not available still had a peaceful darshan.\",\"This is a huge and very old temple. Said to be crowded always. It was not easy for us to have darshan. This is one of the Astadasha Shakti Peetams.\",\"The temple is huge and people stand in the queue for 3-4 hrs for darshan. We opted for the VIP entry where we had to pay Rs 500 each and complete the darshan in an hour.\",\"This temple is situated on hill, drive was giving excellent view of the city. I took special pass for Darshan because there was heavy rush in morning hours. As I entered the temple, everybody was entering into a dark room with stairs going down. Finally Darshan completed.\",\"This is a famous temple and hundreds of people visit it daily but surprisingly there is no guidance offered by the temple authorities for visitors. For example the timings when darshan is not allowed or the types of darshan available. Reaching the sanctum can be quite a tiring and time consuming experience.\",\"I queued up in the paid line. One had to stand in a narrow passage ( with iron grills on both sides ) which is just enough for a person to stand. My worry is that if a person is in the queue there are people ahead and behind him in hundreds. There are lot of elderly people. If someone feels ill how can he be brought out. There are no openings in the grills and during my visit I did not see any temple authorities to monitor the movement of this huge crowd. Since the waiting time for Darshan can take several hours, there should be provision for toilet facilities. Funds , I am sure is not the criteria. Here there should take the procedures from Tirupati .\",\"While the place is beautifully located on the nilanchal mountain, there is an abnormal delay and queue for darshan.\\nSpecial queue at Rs500 which is limited.\",\"We didn't do the darshan as we had to wait in a queue though it was not crowded at all. The temple museum is worth a visit. Temple itself recommended only for devotees.\",\"This is one of the Sakthipeets which is very famous and considered as a temple that should be visited. The temple itself is not very large but there is considerable crowd due to the tourists who line up in a long queue, after paying Rs 500/- for the darshan! As the inside portions of the temple are narrow, there is consideable jostling inside.Also, there is some water on the floor and insufficient light. One has step in with some care; but the darshan itself is very close to the deity!\",\"If going for general public darshan, then it may take around three hours or may be more. If possible, choose the VIP one and get early Darshan.\\nVery serene place and the management of Darshan line is very professional. They provide complementary water and tea in between.\",\"The temple has an unexplained aura about itself, which is indescribable. The temple is situated atop a mountain. Getting here is easy. Nearest railway station has same name. Once inside the premises, you can see a architectural marvel. Only flip side is long queues( I had gone on Sunday, and whole day was spent for the Darshan). The actual site is deep inside the temple where water is flowing.\",\"One of the shaktipeeths of the Goddess. Divine experience. Long queue for general darshan (free).

We obtained blessings from ma and consider ourselves lucky.\",\"I was planning to visit this temple for past 4 years but got a chance this time only. This is a big temple and one must visit once to this place. They have a facility of VIP darshan on chargeable basis (INR 500/- per person). If you are runninng short of time, you can avail the facility. One thing that needs lots of improvement is darshan proceedings. It takes 4-5 hrs. when there is no rush. Anothere thing is lighting arrangements. It is alsmost dark at the darshan place and at stairs. At least some lights must be placed there.\",\"My compliments to the Mandir Management Committee to maintain & upkeep the Mandir premise neat & clean which is an welcome move. Our darshan was very smooth with the blessings of the God Almighty. My only suggestion to the authorities that parking area should be more organised & properly marked.\",\"Need minimum 2 hours for the visit. I started around 6 am , thinking that temple opens at 5:30 am. However, it does open but not for devotees. At early morning even , there was big queue. One can buy ticket for inr 501, which would give quick access.  For paid ticket , people start queuing up at 6 am. Would suggest to start early morning if you want to finish darshan in couple of hours. Beware of sants and sadhus who would ask for dakhsina and donation on the name of Puja.\",\"you must visit the temple, but you must be aware of timings for special darsan, which take less time.

But when i come out from the main temple, after darshan, that was amazing super power blessing/feeling. It is the temple of old age, where part of mata sati fallen, one of the shaktipith. You can visit from morning to evening. For darshan of main gruh, you need passion as it takes more than 4 hours atleast. Dont visit after 4 pm if want to do darshan. You can do mukh darshan without queue. Temple having various antique sculpture of godesses, and having holy effect. There are also cases of bali I have seen. This is amazing place having aura of mataji and you really feel satisfied, worth visiting and taking blessing.\",\"Time of visit : Mid oct 2015\\n\\nThis was my second Visit the temple is very Powerfull , it's not maintained very well as peoplehere belive in animal sacrifice so you could see lot of that happening around.\\n\\nImportant thing is you have to reach the temple by around 7AM to get spl Entery tickets as they close it Very quick.

Temple is on a hill top.\",\"lovely location,on hillside and very good fervour but sacrifice of animals(nothing against the practice) in open view of waiting devotees can be avoided. Darshan sells! Are less priviledged not worthy of equal treatment? Is discrimination on basis of money constitutional? Is apathy towards common people waiting in line for darshan for 5-6 hours where as moneyed go straight inside sanctum sanctorum guided by priests, culture of our religion and society?

We could have opted for 500 rupees special darshan but we had time in our hand. While waiting in queue, devotees can sit at places and the queue was very well maintained. The holy water related to Goddess Sati is located in the main sanctum which is located below ground level of the main temple and one has to climb down steep dimly lit steps to reach there. Outside the temple at a designated location one can light diyas and incense sticks. Many devotees were sacrificing innocent goats & pigeons for their own selfish gain in life which made me feel sad.\",\"Awesome place to be with friends and family.

A must visit place if U are physically fit and have 4-6 hours to spend along with the cost of VIP ticket.\",\"The temple has a positive vibe, a spiritual feel and transcendent atmosphere. But due to extremely poor management it takes a lot of time to get the darshan. Surrounding needs improvement and better maintenance.\",\"1st dont visit on Tuesdays or on holidays.

Seemed that we could reach not before 5 in the evening.There are 4 options for quick \\\"Darshan\\\"1) Reach before 8 am and grab your VIP tickets of Rs 500. The vip ticket counter opens by 8.2) Fix a panda one day prior to your visit and ask him to buy VIP tickets next morn for you definitely at extra cost.3) If you are influencial, then get a VVIP pass issued from Police and have a free entry via the exit door.            and finally if you fail in all 3 above options use the DESI TECHNIQUE....4) Negotiate with a Panda or priest loitering around the main temple and get an entry through the exit gate smoothly like the VVIPs.Now dont ask me how I did.\",\"An extremely neat, clean, well organized and managed Temple. Early morning darshan is strongly recommended\",\"We 3 went for darshan today.reached at around 10 am,purchased Pooja material and rs 500 tickets and sat in waiting room.After about 30 mts were made to enter line separate from general line.Both lines can accommodate 80 people and are opened one at at a time and takes around 30-40mts to finish for each.General line thus if too long can be real time consuming.We had great darshan of MA with assistance of pundit although garbh Graha was fully covered with flowers.

Our Darshan was completed by 6 PM . Inner sanctum is very narrow and can feel a bit claustrophobic.  Experience is divine though.\",\"It is a sacred pilgrimage spot. But I suggest not to visit on holidays or Sundays. Darshan has VIP tickets and regular darshan. When we went on a Sunday, the VIP ticket counter had closed at 845 am. We were told it would take 3-4 hours to reach the sanctum in the ordinary line and 2-3 hours in the VIP line. Moreover they close for lunch, so if ur in the line at that time, u get stuck for a couple more hours. All this put us off.\\nArchitecturally beautiful.\\nWe saw goats and doves being taken for sacrifice which made us a bit queezy. However, it's situated on a hill overlooking the city and offers great views. Public transport is available.\",\"Management is impeccable. VIP passes are not always available.  It took us 3 hours in general queue for darshan but temple staff managed it so well that you won't know that you have spent so much time in queue. Firstly there is no standing queue up until u enter the shrine. Devotees need to sit on chairs and move onto next chair. The entire area is covered.There are fans for you and people are there to hand you glass of water at every point. Don't get disheartened that you need to wait min 2- 3hrs as the Management and Darshan will make you feel blessed\",\"I went with two other friends for darshan and stood in queue at 9:30am and reached at 11:30am to the main temple . To add to my disappointment we dint even spend 2min and it was utterly dark inside the temple, sort of gory. There were sheep and goats everywhere in the temple arena and I asked my friend what the deal with all the slaughtering. Then he told me the entire story of how it came to be a shakti peetha and how pious it is.

Long queues for temple visit even in the 500rs darshan.. so be prepared to spend good 2 hours atleast for the darshan\",\"Had a very good darshan at the temple and felt blessed. While the purohits did not demand money to take around the temple, we paid out of our gratitude.\",\"It was crowded and were told that it would take an entire day to complete the darshan. There was an alternate darshan which we were taken by a couple of guys who took 200 per person. Felt more like a con because all were allowed to take that queue anyways and which did not take more than 20 minutes for darshan of an alternate idol placed. The actual sanctum sanctorum darshan is not possible this way. Dont get conned by these folks posing in pujari dress. If you have time take the normal darshan or the Rs 500 darshan.\\nThe surroundings are also not very clean with all the goats roaming around.

Although we had to wait for an hour to get a 'darshan' it was well organised by the temple which maintained a strict discipline in letting people in batches. The priests at the inner sanctum are very helpful and inform you of the significance of the temple,its location and its deity, and they do not expect anything in return. The entire experience was hassle free and you get enough time to appreciate the temple and its inner sanctum.\",\"Very nice place to visit but must make sure that you have the best guide with you to guide through the temple premises as there are a lot of things to see with a mythological story associated with it.

The last 3 km approach to the temple has lots of twist & turns. Limited parking is available at the shrine.

Another option is to buy VIP tickets the cost of which is Rs.501/- per person. However VIP passes are issued only till 11am and then again from 2.30pm & it takes approximately two hours if you manage the VIP passes. There is a separate option for Defense Personnel, wherein direct entry is provided at Gate number 3. But the time to obtain these passes are 7 am to 8 am & 3  to 3.30 pm.  Further the temple closes from 1 pm to 2.30 pm. So preferably plan to visit the temple in the morning when the temple has just opened or opening in the afternoon i.e 2.30 pm. The atmosphere near the temple gives you a reverberating feeling of spiritual awakening & the visit gives an immense sense of accomplishment. The temple is very well maintained & beautiful.

There is a gate through which you can see the Shivji/Parvati moorti and can do your darshan. In my opinion, this should suffice.\\n\\nHowever, We were pumped up about the 2 \\\"kunds\\\" (one each dedicated to goddess Laxmi and Parvati) and were keen to see it and therefore needed to get into the queue. Basically you can either go in the free queue (budget 4-5 hours), 101/-, 251 and 501/- queues with varying lengths of time in the queue.\\nWe decided to take the 501/- tickets for the shorter queue. Even with the 501/- queue we took > 90 minutes for the darshan.\\n\\nThe kunds are the inner sanctum of the temple and are accessible only by the queue. you are expected to dip your hands in the kund and touch your forehead. To dip your hand, you have to kneel down and bend into the kund (~ 2 feet). Its extremely crowded at this spot and the queues tend to fail at this point. the ground is uneven and I would not recommend it for the elderly / people with disabilities or those with young kids.\\nDidnt think it was a big deal and on hindsight, could have easily missed it with no regrets..\\n\\nGood to know:\\n1. 501/- tickets apply only for persons> 10 years. Kids under 10 go free.\\n2. No bags are allowed inside the complex. I had to leave my handbag with the shoes and carry my wallet in my hand.\\n3. Cameras are ok. You can click in the complex but not the mandir itself.\\n4. Pandas are nice (unlike in Banaras or Puri). They accepted a no graciously.\\n5. we did NOT see any sacrificial animals anywhere. we did see caged pigeons that you can set free. We did not, because we're quite convinced the pigeons are recycled - caged, freed, caged, freed and did not want to support the \\\"economy\\\" in this way.\\n6. There are several shops that ask you to leave your shoes with them for 75p; but will do so only if you buy the pooja thali from them. We didnt use them, instead used the official temple shoe-stand paying a princely sum of Rs 3 per pair. Happily :-)\",\"Good look from out side , Mukha Darshan is very easy . Always having  crowd -  surroundings are good .  Always seems busy for pilgrimages .\",\"Visited the temple for the first time last week, and was shocked noting the loooong queue. But then somehow -- perhaps it was the goddess -- that allowed me to stay on. Soon enough, we had queued for 6 hours, and were finally able to get \\\"darshan\\\" of this powerful Shaktipeeth. It was rich and humbling experience, further more because of the generous lunch thereafter.\\nThe queuing system was one of the best I have ever encountered: we were moving and sitting on the benches almost through the long wait, and we were offered water and tea. Very well-managed and impressive.\",\"I had the quiet Darshana in this quick personal visit. The season was off so not much rush to negotiate as it remains at most of times. You got to choose right time to have peaceful and quiet Darshana.\\nAlso have archaeological importance as being very old structure.\\nNice place overall.\",\"Well , what u get to see in temples , that too in India, nothing but Pandit's that will upfront ask you for dan daksina.. There is good belief of this temple. Lot of rush to visit the temple, people stand from 5 in the morning and remain in the que. VIP darshan pass is available for 500/person but im that also u need to wait at least 1-2 hours.\",\"Visit was in around the first week of june 2018, reaching there was easy you can book some cab and you can go right to the place, need to climb steps to reach to the shrine, it was way crowded when we went, you need to go early in the morning even if you have to get a vip darshan, defence cuz the que for the them are also big and they do only give those tickets in some said time or hours. The place is being maintained very clean and tidy and the architecture is too being well maintained. Hardly managed to get darshan and the darshan was so peaceful, There is a special darshan for physically handicapped people too but that ticket is also issued at some hour of the day. so the timing should be well known before you go if you want to use any such services.\",\"I visited in Dec 2019, we paid 500Rs special VIP darshan still we had to wait for 2-3hrs. we reached the temple around 9.30 or 10.00 am. after standing in line for 30min we got vip tickets after we waited in a Vip room for 30min more around 3.30 or 4pm we completed our darshan. it gets pretty dark by 5pm in Guwahati or Meghalaya so you cant go anywhere else\",\"You must set aside atleast 2-3 hours, if you propose to join general queue for darshan at Kamakhya temple. Or you can pay Rs. 101 (bribe the almighty?!)and take special darshan. One more option is for 'Mukh Darshan' i.e. darshan from a distance, which is a quick affair. Enter from gate no. 2 for Mukh Darshan.\",\"The walk till the temple has wide steps and shops lined by souvenir/religious items stores. Bags are discouraged to be carried inside.. the vip  ticket ensure faster darshan  at 1-2 hour timelimit.. it's priced at 500 rupees.  Normal lines Take a upton4-5 hours of waiting time. The sanctum santorium is at a low level of a cave/crypt.. it gives you an historic and powerful feel  of history and devotion along with mythology.. One must read about the history, the festivities and the sacrifices made here on wikipedia before visiting. Adds to the mysterious charm.. There is no statue of a devi and the yoni/sculpture of the female reproductive organ which is worshipped is fully decorated with flowers and is unseeable\",\"We visited this hotel by 07am. Waited in the queue to buy special darshan ticket.They control the crowd well and maintain peace in the temple.The priests take care of every person and perform pooja.There is idol in this temple only two pits are there.The priest asked us to take the holy water from the pit and drink.\",\"The temple is great in architecture but the queues are very long most of the year around. The general line can take up to evening to clear. There is a VIP line but even that gets sold quickly for 500 bucks. So if you want to complete darshans at a reasonably good time get in queue early, maybe as early as four in morning. There is a third line called mukhdarshan line which is also good as it passes in front of the deity. You can see the deity and pray but not offer anything to it in puja. I did the last line as I had a flight to catch and it was great. This third line was quickly moving and noone was pushing people around.\",\"This temple is one of the Shakti peet nd is very powerful. The general queue will take a long time whereas the special 500 queue moved much quicker. The moorthy was in the form of water nd is situated deep inside. It was such a divine experience\",\"Very powerful vibes, but watch out for the annual festival after which the temple closes for 4 days. We landed  on the same date and were hassled by the crowed,poor management and the team of coaxing pundits who want all your money and will fleece you. There are two types of Darshan - There is a counter for a VIP Line they sell tickets for 500 Rs per person the counter remains shut between 1-3 PM, this is an assisted tour to inside of the temple. The other is the normal line which might take some time on normal days but on festivals the waiting time might get as nasty as 4-5 hours. There will be many priests following up with you to a Side darshan and will keep nagging you for money (Total Avoid)\",\"This is one of the shaktipith. ensure to reach before 6 pm for darshan. morning hours are generally heavy rush, but by paying higher amount, you can get priority in darshan - something which i hate and don't do, even if i cant make darshan,\",\"Great ancient temple to visit. Must have darshan, very easy access to the temple. Blessings of mata ji.\",\"The wait is too long. The ticket  prices very high. We got cheated by a young punda named Biswa who took rs 6400  fir 3 people for Darshan . He didn\\u2019t  tell us his fees till we got to the temple. It took 3 and half hours for darshan . Thank god they now have some light in the cave . Of course inside the small cave people were pushing each other.\",\"It was a great feeling when you are in the premises of this temple, there are 2 options for darshan, be in queue or take a pass of 500 Rs for priority entrance.\",\"Huge thanks to the detailed reviews written by fellow travellers - I knew exactly what to expect. I was travelling with my mom hence was worried if I had to stand for hours in the queue. Having spent thousands on flight tickets and hotel it didn\\u2019t bother me to pay for special entry. Took Ola from my hotel - cab stops like 10 mins away from the temple. It\\u2019s a short walk lined by shops. As soon as we entered there was a pandit who told us he could arrange for Darshan. I was very clear I needed the special entry tickets and would pay only after Darshan. He came back in 2 mins with the tickets. Within 10 mins I was inside the main shrine. Saw the pandit who sold me the tickets there -he asked for like 50 rs Dakshina and did a small puja. Yes there are animal sacrifice with blood stains in full display - I m a meat eater so it didn\\u2019t bother me but I understand why some people are repelled or upset. Then the pandit led us to the main sanctum. Steps are super narrow. People will push - be careful. There is no idol - you will be asked to touch the water flowing. It\\u2019s really tough as it\\u2019s very dark and suffocating. You need to come back thru the same stairs - now it makes sense why the general queue would take that long! Be prepared to give Dakshina there as well. I don\\u2019t think any of that money goes towards temple maintenance. Within 45 mins we were out. I would visit again. Pay attention to the old statues inside the shrine if you like a bit of history! It\\u2019s safe for women ( me and my mom visited). Once outside you can take pics - it\\u2019s not very clean around.\",\"The place is always very crowded. People line from 4-5AM, even though the place opens later. If short on time, VIP darshan which costs Rs. 500 per person will save at least 3-4 hours. The main shrine is very congested and there is no VIP line once you are inside the shrine. Also in the regular line, at a certain point you get direct view of the goat and pigeon sacrifice, can be very disturbing for many people.\",\"First of all, read a lot about the temple and its importance. There is practically no way you can learn about it when you there. Plan out your timings. The temple opens at 8 am and closes at 1pm, opens again at 3pm till 8pm (? not sure).\\n\\nThere are three darshan queues, Army, Rs.101 (special) and general (free). The Army and Rs. 101 queues have timings (again read about it) and tickets are not available all the time. I went when the counter was closed so I had to join the general queue. I joined at about 1130 am but till about 1pm the queue practically did not progress.\\n\\nThen it progressed but the gates were shut at 1.20pm and I was told it wont open till 3.00 pm. My flight was in a couple of hours and so I had to leave the queue. Unfortunate I could not see the deity.\\n\\nApart from that, this is a fantastic place for photography. Most people are dressed in red and it makes for great pictures. The place has a lot of animals roaming about (for sacrifice, I presume) and its quite a colourful sight.\\n\\nA lot of people roam about in red dress and it is easy to mistake them for genuine pujaris, but it is best to ask them to show their credentials before appointing them.\\n\\nThe temple is right up a hill and you can easily spend the whole day here. If you are taking an auto, negoatiate the waiting charges before hand. It will easily take you 3-4 hours. If the auto driver is not ready to negotiate the waiting charge, tell him there are plenty of transport options to go back and just pay him the one way charge. You can save some money that way.\",\"mple is really sad !!\\nEven if you pay 500 for special treatment and line. No point taking this 500 rs ticket.\\nU will have to end up standing in the que for 3-4 hours at least. Take out time and come and not go for paid entry. Get in the normal entry.\\n\\nAnd also there are no fans coolers during the entire lane till the darshan\",\"The temple is situated on the top of a hill and gives an awesome view of the city. Devotees can actually feel the energy in the temple campus. One can do Tatkal darshan by paying INR 501 otherwise the queue is long and takes 2-3 hours for darshan\",\"Very Peaceful!!\\nmust Plan before you go & if possible try for VIp Darshan slip and keep Time & standing capacity with you to go & have Darshan!!\\nBut I am sure you will have peaceful feeling after Darshan!!\\nJai Mata Di!!\",\"Visited here today just after Durga Dasami...Temple was very crowded... Special Darshan Tickets sold out... Waited in General Queue.. Started from 3:10pm Completed 6:30pm... Very well managed queue system...Fans and seats all along the queue...Darshan done pretty comfortably....Even my son did not got restless.....  Mobile and camera allowed in temple but photography restricted from few meter away of the main temple if you are in a queue. Tips: Better to visit early to buy Special Darshan Tickets @ \\u20b9501 per head (Children up to 10 years free)\",\"Visited this place in May 2017. Nice temple on top of hill. It's one of the shaktipeeth as per Hindu mythology. But it takes quite a lot of time to have darshan. There is no idol in this temple. In garbhgriha there is a area which has the holy water filled which needs to be touched for goddesses blessing. It is lit only with earthen lamps and thus quite dark. We reached there by 1:30 pm on a Friday. Though the temple is closed from 1 pm to 2:30 pm, people line up in queue to wait for darshan. When we went the general darshan queue was quite big and we thought of taking VIP pass. The VIP pass cost 501\\u20b9 per person. We checked with one of priest in temple premises if we should take the pass. He informed that VIP pass counter will open at 3 pm and you should join the general queue as it will be cleared first. So we joined the queue and we came out after darshan in 2 hrs. The temple manages the general queue and VIP queue very well and there is no chaos. You get a very good darshan.\",\"This is a very important Devi temple in this part of the country.  If you have the time do visit this temple.  See that you have atleast 3-4 hours while going into this temple, since the crowds are huge.  I spent around a couple of hours in the general queue in the early morning.  The queue starts forming from early in the morning.  Since I was alone, the pandits/tauts did not trouble me at all.  The Darshan was very fulfilling.  There are a number of eating places around the temple.  You can take a bus to the foot hills of the temple and take a share taxi to the temple.  Not very expensive to reach the temple.\",\"A very well known temple. You can book for special Darshan for Rs 501 in case you want to avoid long Que although even in  this que it took about one hour to reach Deity.\",\"Please plan for morning darshan with 2 hours expected darshan entry with special tickets booking for Rs 500.The rush is round the year and blessings for the devotees.\",\"Inspite of all the information gathered before,when we reached the temple premises at 8.30 AM,we were told that people who bought vip tickets before us will be able to finish the Darshan by 2pm.\\nIt is only with the help of a local boy,we could manage a senior Pandit ji who managed to get us Darshan and we were out at 10am.\\nMy advice thus would be to get the sevices of Pandit ji.\\nIt did cost us Rs 2100 but it saved an entire day.\",\"This temple is one of the most famous Devi temples in the country. The Devi is very powerful. The general queue is quite long and may take about 4 hours or so for darshan. The ticket for special queue is Rs.500 and can have darshan in about 2 hours or so.\\nThere is one idol in the ground level but the original Devi is one level down.\\nThe temple is on top of a small hill\",\"I liked the holy atmosphere and the obvious devotion of pilgrims to this Shakti Peeth. However, parts of the complex could have been cleaner, parking was haphazard, and the 'panda' who offered to organise darshan effectively cheated us by taking us via an external route to a distant viewing (about 25 feet away from the sanctum sanctorum), and said that \\\" the line was too long, you would not have had even this view if you'd joined the queue\\\". Reminded me of why I've given up visiting temples.\",\"Too much of a crowd and waiting period was seven hours so we managed with the help of a pandit and has the darshan of outer sanctum as inner sanctum had a waiting period.\",\"Temple is on small hills which is 10 -15 mins drive, normal darshan is good, but they have paid ones which are quicker, amazing place for worship, very powerful and holy.\",\"I went for the darshan around 1:00 by grace of Ma both the time got chance to get through without waiting...\",\"It was Sunday when visited. there was a great rush for the Darshan. however some pandits can arrange the Darshan on payment. No good arrangement for shoe changing.\",\"Proper management for Devotees for Darshan. At least 3 Hrs. required. Local transport Easily available.\",\"Its one of the must visit places when u r in the city.We were planning to go directly from airport on a sunday but our taxi driver has advised against it as it would be very croweded n might take 5-6 hours for darshan so decided to go while returning.We went back on thursday .For normal darshan they said it would take 5 hours.The rs.500 tickets were closed.We were fortunate enough to get 1000 rs tickets n our darshan was done in 15 minutes.\\nIf u r travelling with kids n elderly people go in the morning hours to get the special darshan tickets or else u would end up in long queue.\",\"The temple is beautiful. Remains crowded most of the time and one can find himself lucky, if not crowded. However, the management has a taken very nice step of pass system to enter the temple. VIP passes are available at a price of 501/- from the counter inside temple which opens for about 20 mins by 12 noon approx (i don't remember time exatly). It took me about 1 hour for darshan even after having VIP passes and people in queue were standing since 12 hours in general line..\\n\\nAs of temple, its very beautiful, dark and quite. However, if u have Rs 100/- for donation, u can have good darshan otherwise pandits will ask u to leave within 2 seconds..\",\"Was visiting with my 10 months old daughter and had to leave the darshan queue due to frequent attacks by monkeys who knows about your capabilities and prasad you are carrying. Did not want to spend money for darshan but had to do so because my daughter got frightened.

One is normal queue, which can take anywhere between 2-4 hours. Other is the VIP darshan where you pay 501 for the pass.

One of the shaktipeet of goddess sati. Devotion to visit this temple comes through faith and belief but perseverance comes with one\\u2019s own patience. You may find long ques which takes around 7-8 hours to have a glimpse of inner sanctum. I propose to take VIP tickets straightaway and saves your time. Cost of each VIP ticket is \\u20b9501 which gives one upper hand then rest of the visitors and gives you priority in Darshan. Still try to reach as early as possible to make your visit quick and smooth.

Kamakhya's blessings is sought after by one and all &no one returns empty handed from her abode.This is the place where one of the organs of the Devi fell. People across the country make it a point to visit the Devi's shrine for her blessings.The queue is generally large and it takes about an hour to reach the Devi (except during special puja days) . Pandas generally help the people in guiding them inside the mandir.I have visited so many times and every time the Panda helped me with the puja &darshan though I had to stand in a gueue. What ever I pay they accept it with a smile. I You just name your Panda and no one will bother you.The visit is a good experience for everyone.Some people come up to\\nget their wishes fulfilled while some come to get the blessing of the Goddess for any important work.This phenomenon is common everywhere in the world but the form may be different.Few things need a change no doubt but this will take time indeed.Many of us do not like animal sacrifice and have written about it strongly too.Slowly the mindset is also changing.Many people bring the animal and after puja let it go scott free.\\nYou may also visit the large Tortoise and call it by name,it will come up.Though the area is cleaned regularly still the pressure of devotees are so high that the maintenance need more manpower to sustain.When the belief is supreme we all have to overlook the shortcomings at times but may put in our suggestions for improvement.We can see Sadhus from all over the country there at times .The place is worth visiting.The way up and down the hill is worth enjoying too.\",\"I like the temple from my child hood but 1st time i visited the temple in the year 2000. I have visited the temple more than 5 times since 2000. facility and clenliness are incressing day by day except the back side of pond. Becareful from Panda. Rest are nice.\",\"Was pleasanty surprised to see clean surroundings and an orderly crowd thronging the surroundings of the Kamakhya Temple. I had heard of Pandas hounding the devotees but did not experience or witness any such incident. Overall a pleasant visit.\",\"The temple is on hill top. About 150 steps beyond taxi point. It is better to hire a Panda. We could not go to cave below but did Darshan  of the idol on ground floor. Sunday rush was there and no VIP tickets till 3.00 pm.local people were also coming. Must visit.\",\"The pandas are good and helpful, they dont extract money like in so many religious locations. The drive to the temple is good, avoid the rains.\",\"Winter is the time when people flock to this place primarily due to school closure and ours time was on once such day.\\nThere are 2 lines, one which takes you to inner sanctum (Garbh Graha) and second which takes you have a look from outside. No matter which line you are in, the minimum time is two hours.\\nI have read there are VIP lines for 500/- rs each, which I am told has been discontinued.\\n\\nI have also read in some reviews that unlike in many popular temples, here Pandas do not ask for money to get you early darshans. That's not true, in the 2 hours of standing in line, we found multiple people being approached by such people in red shirt and took them inside via specially built doors. One such guy also offered us the service which we denied.\\n\\nTemple is good and clean and being a special day, it was decorated very nicely. Its worth a visit to the temple. No wonder its THE top thing to do while in Guwahati. Its a MUST.\",\"In this temple I was converted into Brahmin. This temple is well maintain by the management of the temple and the view from the top after climbing few stairs towards pandas home is magnification, breath taking. The pujas arrangements are good and maintaining of cue is also upto the mark. Yes parking have some issues but can be neglected. The pandas on entrances are bit irritating. Rest all fine.\",\"Very ancient temple .  One of the Sakthi Peedam. If we buy special ticket for Rs.500/ we can complete Dharshan within one hour. Decent administration and disciplined que system. Forget about the Pandas as they are alike in all pilgrimage centres and enjoy peaceful dharshan\",\"got a very good Darshan of Maa Kamakhya.. Unlike the reviews that we got for the temple, there was not much hassle from the Pandas nor too much interference from devotees there.. we went there around 7pm... check the temple timings before going..\",\"You will need a bus/auto ride rise to the temple else hire a private cab.The temple is worth a visit specially for its historical value.You will need to visit before 10 am if you want to have a Vip ticket which will take you down the cave in no time.Else stand in the normal queue which might take 3-4 hours.Not miche hassle from the pandas,this is a must see if you are in Guwahati..\",\"Almost all places in india have this back door entry thing and that is what helps. Standing in the queue for the darshan might have made this a job but the panda got us a back door entry straight to the inner temple and we were like happy and blessed..\",\"I had visited Kamakya temple on march 31, 2018. We were asked to stand in the que which I noticed not at all moving.  One panda near the entrance approached and advised us to buy some pooja material so that he could take us inside the temple through the back gate. He took us inside the temple through back gate and chanted some manthra and demanded Rs. 1000/  his service charge which we paid and left the place. The management of the shrine should take necessary steps to stop exploitation of tourists by this pandas.\",\"Everytime I go there I find mental peace and it is such a place that you will find no cheating by the Pujaris/Pandas like other religious places.\",\"Well organised and maintained shrines of North East. It is one of the Shakti peeth and has immense number of devotees.\\nWe took the vip ticket and we're able to give puja and do the Darshan in one hour.\\nThe best thing is the Pandas aren't much of a bother here unlike other important places of worship in India\",\"We were a family of 3 adults, went early in the morning, bought Rs.500/- ticket, sat in an A/c hall / stood in the queue for about 3 hours and had a very good, most satisfying darshan. Avoid pandas.\",\"Since this one of the well known religious destinations in India one has to compare it with other major temples in India. The crowd management, the discipline and general ambience is superlative compared to a lot of other temples in India. Despite the crowd the noise level is low and there is no eve teasing, pushing or shouting. One can buy a vip ticket for 501 rupeees but this too will make you stand in a line for over one and half hours on a holiday. The security staff offer water to people waiting. The pandas do not demand money and are polite. Before entering the temple one is taken to a small pond  to wash ones feet and hands. Before entering the temple while is waiting to enter one can go the bali place where goats, buffalo and pigeons are offered in a ceremonial manner to the goddess. This is not for the faint hearted. Despite the sacrifice the place is clean and there is no unpleasant odour. People are allowed into the temple in batches. The best thing is that the interior of the temple has a great air conditioning system. This ensures that despite the crowds one does not feel so claustrophobic. The garbha  griha is at a lower level like a cave. This is where things get a little chaotic.One is supposed to touch the water,splay it over ones head and drink it. After darshan  the pujaries makes one light a diya and agarbatti near the exit. One then takes a circle of the mandir.\",\"Liked:neat and clean. Disliked:we did not like the pandas pestering. The temple is of great religious significance. The location of the temple is very good. There are places to rest and enjoy the serinity of the environment for which we go to that distance.\",\"The temple is neat and orgnaised.  But pandas are making money in every corner.   They insist the visitors to touch the main deity and demand money.  This practice should be stopped.   This is taking lot of time for worship and the Que is not moving.\",\"It is one of the oldest of the 51 Shakti Pithas. The notoriety of Pandas are famous. Long queue is added worry. Total commercial place. Nobody is concerned about surrounding environments. Rampant infrastructure development can be seen instead of maintaining the natural beauty.\",\"A must Darshan if u r in Guwahati. There is long que of darshanarthi. Since we were in hurry, we had bought tickets  for quick entry. There is heavy rush & don't get into Panda people. Simply go for Darshan , it is an amazing feeling which cannot be explained.\",\"My friends were to go to Guvahati and I was tempted to join them only because I wanted to be blessed by Kamakhya Mataji, one of the most powerful Shakti Pitha out of 51 in India. We went early in the morning and hence had not to face the crowd. Our friend at Guvahati made arrangements for pandas for offering puja and they led us in the temple without any hassle. With their help we could offer puja very nicely and felt very much blessed. In the temple we felt very much powerful feeling of inner peace. However, there were some pigeons and goats for sacrifice in the temple. It was no good and also the temple needs more cleanliness.\",\"Plenty of pandas but not pestering . One can hire on for special pujas like homam, kumari puja, Bali etc. For darshan 501 rupee line is shortest and moves straight to the Garv griha where you can touch the mother and the water, Beside resides Kamala and Saraswati/ Matangi. Don't forget to visit each mandir of das mahavidyas. I couldn't find Shodashi mandir, and nobody could give me a proper answer about it. However Kumar I puja is the most important puja here. Do perform it at a reasonable price of 2500 if you can.\",\"Go with a devout frame of mind and the divine mother makes all her children welcome. Lucky to find a Panda who didn't bargain and was actually helpful and happily disposed through out.\",\"Temple is one of its kind in India..We were lucky to not face long queue and got to reach  the innermost sanctum within half an hour.. Naughty Ram bhakta Hanumanji is everywhere and one needs to be careful with offerings bought for Maa as it can get snatched..The experience of reaching the sanctum is mixed.

Good parking facilities are available. The Pandas (priests) are not the obnoxious lot normally seen at so many other temples and often are good guides for the tourists.The main concern is the lack of cleanliness.  The whole way up to the temple from the parking lot is full of small shops, cattles, goatsetc. Even inside the temple premises the area is littered with pigeon / goat droppings. There is an altar for sacrificing animals / pigeon and drops of blood can be seen here and there. The temple authorities will do well to improve upon this aspect.\",\"Most Crowded Devotional Site of North Eastern India. It is one of the best Well managed Temple in India with Pandas not like other Temples trying to drain your pocket. Gives you peace of mind....\",\"Good and clean ambience. Pandas and purohits are far better than other temples in India. Darshan was well organized.\",\"Wonderful religious place with mystic effect. There is no rush at 3.30 pm . but it will be close at 4:25 pm. So better come at time. And if you hire panda then you can do Pooja with proper guidence\",\"When you reach temple directly goes to the administration counter and ask for the ticket. Dont go to any pandas or Poojaris.  They will mislead you with all nonsense and upset and spoil you r day.\",\"PANDAS are very helpful, great scenic beauty all around the TEMPLE, easy approach to the temple from GUWAHATI CITY,\\none of the oldest hindu temple in INDIA\",\"visited this famous shaktipeeth temple which is situated on a hill overlooking the mighty river brahmaputra. it is said that when shiva dismembered sati, one of her organs fell here.\\nthis area has undergone sea change over the years. now it is more organized, traffic under control and more or less cleaner than other peeths we have visited.\\nseeing a long q we decided to expedite our visit as we were short of time and hired a panda. the panda took us inside the temple and showed us the deity from behind a grill and we exited. not being satisfied we again visited. this time we joined the q (well organized movement, no push or shove,drinikng water being served, fan on the enclosures)and proceeded in an orderly manner. reached the deity touched it, submitted our offerings,and were on our way to the sanctora sanctum-where the so called organ rests and after offering our prayers exited. a much satisfying visit.\\nwhat was surprising was that there was no push,shove by local staff (as in sai baba temple in shirdi or vaishno devi temple in katra) or shouts.\\nwe exited through another gate and some one came forward requesting us to partake of \\\"anna bhog\\\" and emphasized free of cost and gave us coupons. once inside the dinning area coupons were exchanged for thali and food- khichri, sabzi, some fries and kheer(with raisins almonds and smelling of kesar) was served.the dining area is segregated for males(standing only), and females-sitting respectively. areas were very clean no food residue from previous diners were seen.one could eat as much one wished- no constrains.\\nrequested the supervisor to provide disposable spoons along with the plate for eating.only the washing area could have been cleaner and smell free.\\noverall an excellent unusual experience\",\"We visited this must - see temple in Guwahati and we're definitely drawn by the unique concept of Sati's womb having fallen here and being worshipped for so many years. It is not something that one comes by in Hindu temples. We went in the afternoon and waited for the temple to reopen at 2 PM. The ticket window opened 35 mins late and we got the special entry ticket (500 rupees for one). But after that the darshan was very quick as there were no lines (this was a Tuesday). Inside, the temple is not very well maintained or organised. We saw big cockroaches right when the sanctum Santorum starts and dead ones too on our exit that got squished under the feet of devotees. I was quite taken aback and distracted at the sight of the big cockroaches. Inside the temple each and every panda insists on donation which also puts one off. However, regardless of all that, the temple still is worth a visit for its uniqueness.\\n\\nThe uniqueness is largely attributed to the fact that there is no large idol inside the sanctorum, which is worshipped. Instead the sanctorum is dark and has a small water hole. The idea is unique and connects one to the concept of worshipping the womb, I.e. Creator of life. I wish they had a museum or a proper information centre to help pilgrims and tourists better understand the ideological and architectural importance of the temple. The temple dome is also seen many temples throughout Assam.\",\"the visit & the Puja at the Kamakhya temple was very satisfying ...we had got a good Panda( the priests who help in performing Puja) and everything was hassle free...we had gone for a Rs. 500/- paid queue as we had old people with us ...so the wait was only for 10 min.. the Panda ( Mr. Sharma) was well versed with the history of the temple and the rituals of the Puja..and the price for his service?? anything that we wanted to give.. no haggling, no sledging, no bullying..we gave him 200 for 5 of us for almost 2 hours of service...\\nbut be careful of the priests inside the temple ...they ask for money at every turn...our Pandaji had warned us of the same in advance and saved us from the bullying.\",\"I went on a 5 day trip of Assam & Meghalaya from 19th April to 23rd April with my wife. Since I read from the reviews in Trip Advisor that there is lot of crowd in this temple on week ends and also on Tuesday & Friday, we purposely started from Bengaluru on Thursday morning flight on 19th Thursday, reached our hotel (Nandan in G.S.Road, Pulton Bazar) at around 1.30pm as the flight was delayed by almost 2 hours, and once checked in, took a taxi arranged by hotel, and went straight to the temple, as the first thing to do in our 5 days' trip of North East.\\n\\nLuckily for us, there was no rush at all on that day. Once we entered the temple premises, a Panda (poojary) approached offering assistance. We asked him his fee, he said whatever we pay he will accept as \\\"dakshina\\\". We agreed for Rs 300 for both of us put together. He started to guide us immediately, took us to the Rs 501 special darshan counter where there was no queue at all. After purchasing the tickets, he directed us to a small queue of 10-15 persons in the special darshan queue. We could complete the darshan with his help/guidance within just 20 minutes from the time we stood in the queue.\\n\\nAfter darshan, we paid his dakshina and spent 20-30 minutes in the temple premises on our own, taking some photos, and pouring some oil into the \\\"diyas\\\" kept inside the premises.\\n\\nFor those pilgrims who want to avail guide from the above mentioned poojary, I am giving his mobile number 7002803138. It is not necessary that we should go through Rs 501 tickets only. He can also guide pilgrims who opt for free darshan. I do not remember his name.\\n\\nFor the taxi arranged by hotel, we paid Rs 800 for visit to this temple and also for visit to Umananda temple immediately after Kamakhya visit. We used the taxi for almost 5 hours.\",\"Visit to this temple is must for everyone coming to Guwahati.We visited during Navratras the auspicious days, the temple was very crowded. I took a paid darshan by paying Rs 501 per person at the temple counter. It took nearly 90 mins to have darshan of the Garbh Griha & complete my worship at the temple. Public transport and autos are available to reach the temple which is located on a hill top. The great thing is that the Pandas do not harass the visitors.\",\"After waiting for four & half an hours in a queue I got the scope to darshan of maa kamakhya devi. I think without any help of panda it is very difficult to enter into the main temple.\",\"Had a very good puja in khamakhya temple this time. The pandas are very decent and well behaved. They charges minimal for the darsan and puja.\",\"Visited with my family, people from around the country come here to worship the deity. Sacrifices are also made here in the name of offering to GOD. One must read the stories  and myths associated with this temple before visiting. Beware of pandas and tantriks in and around the temple.\",\"This is one of the high profile and famous Sakthi temples in India. We are just put off with the following, that squarely dissipates any sense of inborn serenity, calm, and that ethereal feeling one would long to experience.\\n- Approach path to the Temple is littered, spittooned, marked by the unhygienic environment, abject neglect, cow dung, goat and pigeon droppings etc.,\\n- No signage nor directions nor any information about the so called VIP passes\\n- No info on the timings, ticket prices, conduct etc., nor any cleanliness within the premises except a lone crusader trying to stave off the eager beaverly tourists and cattle alike\\n- Horrifying scenes of the animal sacrifice that is routinely carried out\\n- Panda's day out at the expense of the tourists: neither any proper agamic or vedic ritual nor any sense of devotional feeling within the sanctum: so much so that the inner environment is thoroughly taken over by the Panda mafia\\n- Same is the case with the exact spot where in Yoni of Mother Goddess is supposed to have been lying in the well of a upsring of water...\\n- overall, its just an avoidable experience. Wish the temple authorities( if any) emulate an iota of management from TTD( not that its a benchmark, but relatively well maintained despite the influx of a atleast 50-60K devotees everyday)\",\"They let us in when the gates were closing! No panda followed you.  In fact we requested one to help us get a good darshan. Remember 1 to 2 pm gates are closed. Finally prasad was good with khichdi, sabji,  papad and kheer. Too many steps. Difficult for aged.\",\"It was a pleasant visit. According to Hindu Mythology This place has its own significant. Neat and Clean Temple. No PANDAS.\",\"If you are not willing to spend money without any reason, allot half a day's time to visit the temple. You can buy VIP pass, that consumes significantly less time, and costs you around Rs 500 + tips for the Panda.\\n\\nIf planning to visit the temple all by yourself,you need to spend around 3.5 hours of time just standing in the queue. Most likely the temple closes around 2-3 pm, Also, if you expect that there will be any preacher will do the puja for you after you enter, then you need to face the facts. No one is going to do the puja for you, neither any preacher nor any one alike, if you have not taken the VIP pass to the temple. I bought all the puja items before entering the temple,and took it back in the exact same condition as the \\\"prasadam\\\". Literally heartbroken!!\\n\\nGave the three stars to justify my happiness for visiting this place.\",\"Amazing energy at the temple if you can ignore the pouncing pandas! Visited the Dasmavidhyas around the Kamakhya.But the sight of the animals ready for sacrifice is disconcerting.\",\"The trip to Kamakhya Temple was refreshing. There is no disturbance by Pandas at the temple. You can engage one for help and guidance, at your sole discretion.The queue of devotees are disciplined and well managed.\",\"It was a very differen experience for me. What I liked most is that unlike many temples, this temple did not have Pandas and shopkeepers bothering the people who came visiting the temple. This is situated at the top of a hill so one has to leave the vehicle quite a long way off. the climb is gradual so it is easy on the legs. One can choose to leave the slippers and bags at the shops selling the Puja items or in their vehicles. Cameras are allowed inside with no one restricting .\",\"Even after paying 500 for special darshan, the line after a certain points mixes with the general queue and also the Panda's inside the sanctum makes life difficult for devotees to pray. Otherwise a calm atmosphere.\",\"A very ancient temple with beautiful art and history within, but a very pathetic situation currently.\\n\\nIt is a pain to know that a temple which all people from different parts of the country visit with such great devotion is in such a condition.\\n\\nCleanliness here is Zero !\\n\\nThere are money makers in the form of pandas or the pujaris in the temple. There are many many of them waiting for devotees to fall prey. They demand money as if it is their birth right.\\n\\nDo not accept anything from any of these pandas. Even if you accept by mistake a grain of prasad, you will have to end up paying money for that or fight with them.\\n\\nWe visit there to worship the deities and not to pay or get harassed by pandas.\\n\\nVisited November 2014\",\"very nice temple and really helpful people to guide you, the pandas who help it puja in the temple are friendly and no haggling when v are with them\",\"the best temple in the this world feel the presence of goddess parvati, the natural beauti , its surroundings ,  the most educated & decent pandas are to help you.\",\"Lovely temple. Felt the blessings of the mother. Definately a must go if one visits Guwahati. None of the pandas asked for any money as dakshina. We gave whatever we wanted and wish that others also can enjoy the grace of the mother\",\"One of the 51 Shakti Peethas. Be prepared for long queues or be prepared to pay Rs.500 for a quick Darshan. There are also several pandas (priests) who try to sneak you past the queues for a quick buck.\\n\\nFree lunch is offered at the temple between 12 to 3,which consists of some Kichdi, Payasam and papad. It was quite delicious\",\"A very happy experience. Was planning to visit since a long time.\\n\\nVery busy on Tuesdays and Saturdays Even on other days one has to wait for about 2 hours to have the Darshan.\\n\\nVIP entry tickets @ Rs 500.00 are available at certain times. However pandas will help those interested for a premium at other times too.\\n\\nCity buses ply upto the foot of the hill. From there one can hire auto rickshaw upto the temple or get a bus if lucky. Ola cab dropped us very close to the temple entrance.\",\"Kahamkhya Temple is one of the shaktipeeths. Its a very sacred place and it should have been #1 thing to do at Guwahati.\\nyou can feel the power as soon as you enter the temple.\\nUnlike other places this place doesnot have \\\"thug Pandas\\\", but normal pandas. They would help you in offering Puja and are happy with small offering also.\",\"An awesome place for the worshiper of Mata-rani. Undoubtedly a gateway to Assam.

If you come early morning it will take around 3 hours .\\nAs there is only one entry it takes time , unlike other temple like siddhi vinayak or dakshinawar temple.\\nFew panda/dalal/brahmin are there who will tell you to offer prayer in front of kamkhya or shortcut line.\\nIt is totally fake & they will make you visit Krishna idol in the original temple. There is a vip line you can availed same Que will be shorter by around 2 hour.\\nTemples opens at 7.30 am and in the afternoon its closed. Once you enter you can ask someone or security guard about general line.You can have water but no toilet facility in lines.\\nWe find mosquitos & bird feathers. Probably they have note clean the temple in the morning.\\nThere is ten temple in the name of Godess Kali like Kali,Tara, Bhairavi etc. Once you enter in the temple there will be few old idol of Ganesha,Krishna & Shiva.There is one pond inside the premises.\\nThe main idol is down & place is bit dark. You have to mind your step. As lot of flowers & puja offering was there no will able to see the actual stone or idol. Priest will ask you to wash hand\\nin the water beneath idol. Probably ganga jal . The 2nd idol is with the mud & rotten flower. Beware of walls you will find lots of cockroaches.Out side temple is cleaned properly .\\nI would request trustees to have atleast one light & flowers & other puja offering should be cleaned properly every day . Goat sacrifices are regular customs but here we find pigeons sacrifices\\nalso. Few pigeons were left outside might be due to other rituals. People are selling pigeons outside . I find they cut the wings so that they can catch the pigeons & sell them again.\\n\\nI am a devotee of Maa Kali & from heart I pray to god.I chanted to god & believe god will accept my prayer.\\n\\nDue to Nagpanchami they were also offering prasad to devotees. We had 2 types of vegatables,Dal,Rice,Payesh & Suji.\\n\\nPlease note if you are with you kid/elder person you should avoid see Maa specially through general like. You can visit temple from outside & offer prayers to other idols like Tara.\\nOutside decoration also looks beautiful . There is few resturant outside but they are no hygienic & clean. As most of the devotees offer prayer empty stomach after prayer every body\\nneed some good breakfast but same option is not available. Oily puri is the option everywhere.\\n\\nOverall it is a good darshan & my wish to visit maa fulfilled\",\"My first solo trip and went well.\\n\\nHad my own curiosity about Guwahati Nd Kamakhya temple was a mix of good Nd uplifting.\\n\\nI took the Rs. 500 ticket and it took 2 hours overall for the darshan.\\n\\nThe experience in the cave was good as well \\ud83d\\ude0c\\n\\nI suggest everyone to plan their trip early morning I.e .

If you take a bigger water bottle, he will not fill it for you, hence need to take the smallest one.

It has lot of religious significance. As with any other famous temple, Kamakhya temple is very crowded and it takes hours to get darshan. There are VIP passes available but only in limited number, once those passes get over, counter is closed. Darshan is quicker if you visit early in the morning and able to get a VIP pass.

They will no doubt approach you but, If you don't seek their service they won't push or hang around you.\\n\\nThis is among few Indian temples where foreigners are not barred from entering.\\n\\nMost of the days the place remains packed with pilgrims from throughout India and neighbouring countries. It is best to avoid all holidays if you are a new to the place. The main temple opens at 8 am but as devotees come in great numbers it is better to start at early hours, say by sunrise, the best time to proceed as rush picks up with passage of light.\\n\\nOne can avail bus from Kachari bus stand (half a km from Guwahati railway station) that shuttles between the temple and the city at regular interval, or pick any auto-rickshaw from any part of the city or hire car from below the foothill that runs throughout the day from as early as 5 am till late evening up-till 8 pm. Sometimes even beyond the mentioned period. There are various other temples around within a km from the main temple which also provides fabulous natural views of surroundings.\\n\\nMy suggestions are, if you are capable of walking, walk at least one way down through either the main road or people who are adventurous walk up-down the designated foot road. it is not only enjoyable but also makes you watch the wonderful natural view. The road is absolutely safe for all, so if you find an empty road don't get scared but enjoy to your delight.\\n\\nFor photographers the place offers some magnificent spots for photography. A few spots are located on way to Bhubaneswari temple.\\n\\nFor devotees best period to visit is during Ambabuchi or Ambubachi festival held during the month of June when one can come close to watching Naga Sanyasi (Sadhu or Monk).\\n\\nAttention:\\n\\n1. Leave your shoes at nearby shops that sells offerings for the deity (they don't charge you for your shoes) or with chargeable counters.\\n2. Thefts are extremely rare; if at all has happened, I haven't heard. However, it is better to stay alert.\\n3. You can carry your camera bag and purse inside the temple\\n4. No need to keep on hire taxi or auto-rickshaw as plenty of cars ply down the road\\n5. There is a Govt. run dispensary close-by to attend to any emergency\\n6. General queues are large and non-chargeable or you can enter by paying Rs 100 or Rs 500 to get inside the temple promptly. However, now-a-days those queues too are long. Therefore, check the queue before you decide.\\n7. Lodging facilities are available around for devotees\",\"Whenever I go to Guwahati, I visit \\\" Kamakhaya Temple', and this time was not different.

You can use your own cell phones for selfies. The time Inside for darshan is short but I feel like a new person after 5 days here.\\n\\nDefinitely do the darshan.

But I was really impressed by the systematic way in which the crowd of devotees are handled at Kamakhya Devi temple. You need to purchase a pass, either general or a VIP pass. Thereafter you would be taken to a seating area and would be asked to wait. after that as per our general or VIP passes we would be frisked away to our queues. Mind you, the general or VIP lines are only because of the price of the passes. The VIP pass doesn't give you any special privilege to worship the Devi. After some point of time both the lines converge to be one. Only advantage is that the VIP pass being costlier has a lesser queue and you would reach the entry of the Temple earlier than the people who have the general pass. Once inside you would be mesmerized by the beauty of the temple. It is an ancient temple and you would really feel walking back in time. The devotees are managed very well and everything is very disciplined. I had a precious few seconds to spend with Kamakhya Maa and seek her blessings. A tip, try to get a good pundit who would guide you and explain each and every ritual, like we did. Would definitely come back here again when in Guwahati.\",\"Kamakhya Temple is a wonderful place to visit.\\n\\nIt has a terrific waiting lines and this makes you tired, but the after darshan you feel yourself relaxed.\",\"The compound of the temple is very clean.

The stairs are very slippery and weight so be carefull to go for Darshan. You may spend more time for darshan because every time you find long que in normal way.

Photography is allowed in the temple compound but not within the main temple itself.\",\"Kamakhya temple is one of the unique temple I have seen in my life. This temple is very old and its well preserved inside than the outside. The girbagraha is very uniquely constructed and claimed to be in the shape of \\\"Yoni\\\"(female reproductive organ). There is interesting story on this as per Hindu mythology, please read it from wiki before you visit the temple. If you are travelling by the city buses, bus stops at the bottom on the hill on which the temple is situated. There are plenty of transport available for you to go up and comeback(up 20Rs, down 10Rs, on shared Maruti Van). Make sure you get inside the birbagraha and enjoy the ancient architecture. No photography allowed. I was told that there will be huge queue to get inside, but I was lucky and was able to get in in general queue, there are paid premium queues available(sad, but just like any temples in india), but if there is a huge queue that is the only option.

It is old and rich with stories and history, which is intriguing and you could read about it. Here's how the visit looked and felt. I visited Kamakhya temple when I had an afternoon off while at work in Guwahati. July afternoon, it had just started raining when I set out for the temple. The taxi driver told me it was particularly auspicious if it rains when you visit, the goddess really wants to you to visit and prayers bring fruit on such lucky instances ... started with one of the interesting background stories :) The ride up the hill was beautiful, picturesque. There are 2 view points on the way up and you can request for a photostop or just to take in the view. Takes about 10 minutes to the top. The way up had some more markers for other temples, that I would have loved to explore but did not have the time and chance, but I remain curious because hardly any vehicles were headed on any alternate paths. There a full-fledged bus/auto/taxi stand right outside the temple, which is great ,because If you Uber-ed to the top, you may not be able to do the same for the way back ... wi-fi/internet connectivity is really poor/zero at the top of the hill.\\n\\nThe temple itself ... crowded, messy, mayhem. If you've visited Dakhshineshwar/ Kalighat in Kolkata...it feels almost the same, the moment you step out of your ride, some one is trying to sell you flowers, prasad, a VIP fast-track entry ... same, same!\\n\\nIt's a market place... the beauty finishes after the ride up, there's concerete constructions -- apartments, hotels/lodges all around and that seemed to drawf the temple. Inside, is a huge open area,\\nThere is an outer shrine and an inner shrine, The Inner shrine is the most revered which draws the huge number of devotees.\\n\\nI went right before the Ambubachi festival and the average wait time was insane. There are these narrow enclosures with snaking queues up and down the slope, I asked a devotee exiting after his darshan at 4 pm how long he'd waited in the queue and he said since 5 am. So, honestly, I didn't even consider attempting.\\n\\nThere's a VIP ticket for quicker access which was closed because the crowd was too much. It would cost Rs.100/- if its open. (Also, you can't ride up closer to the time of Ambubachi festival because lakhs of people visit and all climb by foot at that time.)\\n\\nThere was this other option of a priest who would go inside (they can skip queues!!) & pray on your behalf. He will bring you some pink-tinted water in a ziploc bag -- that's the holy water from the inner shrine. He also shared his mobile number and offered to retain & send across a piece of the Goddess's red cloth after Ambubachi festival for a dakshina (service fee for offering prayers -- as understood best by me)...very, very interesting, like I said :)\\n\\nThe outer wall has statues of Siva and Parvati and one of Lord Ganesha, that are worshiped. There are some outer temples, smaller ones dedicated to other Gods, which are not crowded at all, so I visited one of those.\\n\\nAgain, what I loved most was the ride up to the hill. The number of devotees and the sheer devotion to see the shrine was what held me in awe, and I hope I carried back the blessings of the Goddess...The enormity of it all...the structure, the faith, the Goddess's story, and the history of it from the scriptures is an experience in itself.\",\"Kamakhya is 30..40 Min Ride from Guwahati Airport .

When I saw a documentary on Kamakhya, I was compelled to visit in person during my next trip to India and I wasn't disappointed. It has an aura of mystique around it that you can literally FEEL in the air the moment you enter the temple walls. We used the \\\"fast pass\\\" to avoid the long line for an additional Rs. 500 per person and it was well worth it. We also engaged the services of a panda that was the personal priest of our driver who helped us through the process and performed pujas for myself, my daughter and son. It was mesmorizing and full of prana. I highly recommend paying a visit to this important Shaktipeeth and experience it firsthand.\",\"Kamakhya temple is perhaps the only sightseeing place in Guwahati.

However, the lines are long and the actual darshan after the long wait is swiftly over! But the flickering lights, in the dark depths of the sanctum, the slow flow of water, the smell of incense and murmur of the priests' prayers, in those few minutes were sufficient to touch the mind and heart of a devotee.

There is a footway, look like stairs which is named as Mekhela Ujuwa Path which I choose most of the time.

Kamakhya station is also very nearby and almost all superfast trains are having  stopage there. The taxies and buses go upto the temple complex.

VIP passes are available at Rs.500/- per person in limited numbers twice daily  -  morning around 7:00 AM and afternoon around 2:00 - 2:30 pm., however queues for that starts much before than actual time of distribution. One also needs bargaining with pandas for darshan. Average time taken for darshan by General line is 5 - 6 hours and 2 - 3 hours by VIP line. This may increase by atleast 2 - 3 hours on weekends or special holy days. Pandas can also arrange Puja in a shortcut manner by visit of god from outside without entering 'Garbhagriha '. Inside temple one should remain cautious from pandas as they may try to extort money in the name of god, but those numbers are very few.

Also photography is banned inside the main temple, however you can take photos outside the temple.\",\"It is advisable to visit Kamakhya Temple early in the morning. The temple opens at about 8am. But before that there is a big queue of devotees for entering inside the temple. So it is always better to be a bit early. You should be completing your visit by around 10 am if you are early. You may also inquire about special passes at the temple management office which is just adjacent to the temple. For traveling it is better to take a cab right from  the Hotel to the temple. You may also travel through city buses which will take you to the base of the hill ( Nilachal Hill) where temple is situated.

The inside is less suffocating now as more lights and air blowers have been installed.\\n\\nYou can sit outside the temple and feel the peace filling your soul and let you contemplate on your spiritual self. When leaving, be careful with the prasad bags in your hand as there are monkeys looking for opportunity to take it away.\\n\\nIf you have time then take the road further up the hill and get a grand view of the Brahmaputra river and the lights of Guwahati.

It is located on the Nilachal Hill, en-route Guwahati town from the airport. The temple has two classes of entry for the general public, free and paid. Paid entry is Rs 500/- per head. The ticket window opens at 6 am, by which time there is already a fairly long queue. Each person is given only 2 tickets so if you are a large group, many of you will have to stand in the queue. After the getting the ticket you are either pushed into a waiting room or ushered into covered stands and made to wait for your turn. Meanwhile, those with free entry are made to wait in an another queue next to the paid queue, to be ushered into the temple by turns depending upon the length of each queue. The temple opens at 8 am after the morning arti (type of prayer) which is not open to public. An animal supposed to be sacrificed after the arti. Expect to wait for anything between 1 hour to many, even if you have a ticket.On entry the temple has a place for offering and puja (prayer). The garbgriha (sanctum sanctorum) has no idol. The entry and exit to garbgriha is through the same steps making the whole process very slow and unorganized.           The temple has the panda (traditional priests) at every step virtually forcing you to make a donation to one God or the other. There are authorized priests who conduct a special puja for a a fee. As per tradition, many pilgrims do Kanya Puja (worship of girl child) there.  Everything you require for Puja is available just outside the temple. As one walks around one can see lambs and pigeons which are sacrificed at the temple. This is not done in open view and I did not see the sacrifices.  There are a few places to eat and 2 hotels near the temple. Washrooms are available but not very clean.\",\"Visited kamkhya temple yesterday evening,took vip passes as time constraints were there,could do the darshan in 1 hour,had a pleasant time there.must visit for persons visiting Guwahati for the first time & interested in religious sightseeing.\",\"Kamakhya Temple is called the main \\\"Sati Pith\\\" among the 51 different ones distributed all over Asia. It is situated above a hill in Kamakhya, very close to Guwahati. There are buses carrying people to and fro the hill top. The best thing about it is even though it is quite crowdy, there is not so much rush as in other temples. But be sure to come in early hours with lots of time in hand if you want to want to do the Puja.\",\"Don't come to this temple. Takes more than seven hours to complete the darshan. Not because the temple is crowded, guards are taking money and cutting the line. Disgusting to evidence such shameless corruption from temple authority. 500 tickets are only hundred per day, so gets over very soon. Never going to visit this temple. Going to pray to maa kamakhya from home.\",\"Kamakhya temple is a must visit if you are in the region. From Guwahati airport, this would be a car ride of around 50 min. The process of entering the main temple is pretty simple but tedious.\\nMethod 1:\\nYou get into the general category of line. People have to wait in the waiting room and the organiser allow a certain batch of people to join the queue. After a short gap they allow the next batch. And so on. But The queue can get scarily long. On a crowded day, people might need to wait as long as 5 hours to get into the temple.\\nMethod 2: Once you enter the temple door, walk straight (keeping the main temple on your right hand) and you will hit a counter for VIP ticket, It cost Rs 500. Once again, the process is same. They will make you sit in a airy and very clean hall. And then they will allow you to join the VIP queue in batches. Basically you are cutting short the otherwise general line by 75% as the VIP line starts from the last gate before entering the temple.\\n\\nOnce you reach the final gate, its is kind of three lane path (two for general) and one of VIP ticket holder. And the organisers allow alternatively people in batches to enter the main temple (or garva griha).\\nThe final stretch of queue is like a cage (so as to stop intruders from breaking the line) and has many fans so to keep the place well aired.\\n\\nOnce you enter the main temple, it is two parts. The first part is a symbolic idol of Ma Kamakhkhya and then you have to walk down a cave ... it is bit dark and narrow (but not majorly claustrophobic) ... once you walk down 10 steps you reach the most sacred area where Ma's Yoni had dropped....you will find couple of priest sitting in there. They will give you prasadi flower from that guarded place and will ask you to dip your hand into the space and touch the natural spring water which always runs through the area. And then you come out.\\n\\nThis is a must experience.\\n\\nFew points to keep in mind:\\n1. It is also difficult to get the VIP ticket, more so, on days like Saturday, Tuesday, Omabossha, after Ambubachchi, and so on.\\nUsually tickets gets sold within minutes of opening the counter which is 7:00 am.\\n2. The safe bet is get in touch with any of the pandya. They will either arrange for VIP ticket for you before you reach the temple if it is during later hours of the day or will arrange from fellow pandya.\\n3. If you are with a pandya, it is usually easier as they will then meet you straight in the garva griha and arrange for offering puja.\\n4. If you are having very old people or very small kid, I would advise that you might choose to not take them in the temple, as even with a VIP ticket, you have to wait for minimum 60-90 min in the queue and the journey through the temple takes around 30-40 min.\\n\\nBut once again, there is great arrangement of water and the temple is remarkably clean.\\n\\nNeedless to say, it is an divine experience.\\n\\nJai Ma Kamakhkhya.\",\"Beautiful temple...it did not had rush at the time we visited..soulful Darshan of Maa Kamakhya..it is not far from this hotel u can easily get transportation either public or private..\",\"This is located some few kilometers from Guwahati Railway Station and is well connected with local bus and rikshas.

The approach is pretty convenient, very good road and a nice little drive. Since it draws a lot of devotees we were advised to purchase tickets to save time. Each ticket cost us Rs500/. Even after purchasing the ticket we had to wait for an hour before we could enter the main temple. The pujaris over there are the same as in all the other Hindu temples.....fat and insolent, their main aim to make you part with your money....and they are swarming there. The temple is like any other and if you are not to hungho about being a pilgrim give it a miss.\",\"A religious and very scared temple as well as a pilgrimage spot for the Hindus. You have to walk up the hill to reach up to the temple. Beautiful architecture. If you want you can offer pujas but for that you have to stand in a queaue. Otherwise you can also take a round have a look at the beautiful architecture of the place.\",\"We get buses to kamakhya gate from paltan bazzar(Just stand near the Nepali Mandir in paltan bazaar facing Sagar Ratna hotel and you will get buses). The bus fare is Rs 15 from paltan bazaar to kamakhya gate.After getting down at Kamakhya Gate cross the road and one can find many cabs and sometimes a Bus which goes upto near Kamakhya Temple. cabs charge Rs 20 per person from kamakhya gate to the temple.While returning from temple we got ASTC buses from near Kamakhya temple which i think goes to paltan Bazaar,we got down at Machkhowa bus stop(For Alfresco grand brahmaputra  river cruise)and the bus ticket was Rs 10.00             After getting down from Cab/bus one has to climb a few steps to reach the temple.To climb the steps is not strenuous and anyone including senior citizens or those who find it hard to climb many steps can climb these steps. Just before the steps there is a free shoe and luggage keeping centre.Plz keep your shoes/luggage there and do not fall in traps of vendors who will force you to keep your shoes/luggage with them. Mobiles are allowed inside the temple but photography inside the temple is strictly prohibited.               We reached the temple at about 9:15 Am and immediately stood on the queue for free darshan. We heard an announcement at about 10 Am that the VIP(Special) darshan ticket counter is closed(Special darshan ticket costs 500 Rs and i think using this ticket darshan of goddess will be over in about 1-2 hours.) There are seats along the queue to sit and unlike many temple people in queues don't push or jostle here which is good.All were maintaining the queue system which is good. We were out of the temple after darshan at about 2:30 Pm. Priests here don't force for donations and we had the darshan of the goddess in a calm way.                The temple closes for afternoon pooja from about 1:00 pm to 1:45 Pm. I think crowds in afternoon are less so if you have time in afternoon plz reach this temple say by around 2 pm to have darshan as it takes about 5-6 hours in morning for darshan.If you are planning to have darshan in afternoon you can plan to reach this place by 1 pm have free meals and then stand in queue for darshan.                    if you are in Kamakhya during lunch time plz have the free meals served in the temple(Free Lunch time is 12:30-3 Pm i think). This place is situated just a few steps away from exit of temple before the steps. On the day of our visit Kichdi,a gravy dish,pappad and kheer was served for free meals and all tasted good. Plz dont miss the free meals served at the temple.            On the day of our visit a bull was scarified (We cannot see the bull being sacrificed but can see the bull being tied to poles at a place where sacrifice takes place). Also there were many goats tied which were about to be sacrificed.The head of the sacrificed bull was kept inside the temple near the devi .We visited the temple on a navami day so maybe on that day animal sacrifice is done(Not sure if animal sacrifice is done on every day).         Small but religiously an important temple for many Hindu religion followers. Except a few sculptures nothing architecturally beautiful in the temple.         Not many good restaurants near kamakhya temple so if you are coming from Guwahati city in morning i will suggest you to have breakfast in the city itself and then proceed to this temple.\",\"I have been to this temple in the first week of March,2019.

Thus make sure you complete your darshan before this time so that you can have Bhog. Panda's in this temple are quite good, and do not force you or irritate you for the rituals to perform when you are inside the temple. But make sure if you are performing the rituals, you bargain before hand so that you do Puja peacefully.\\nPrasad, Flowers, Chunari etc. you can buy from any stall as per your wish and budget.\\nOverall my personal experience was very nice and was lucky to be blessed by Maa Kamakhya.\",\"The temple was pretty crowded and the road leading to the temple filled with chances to buy the materials for puja and beautifully colourful\",\"Kamakhya is not very far from Guwahati town.

You can board a bus from Paltan Bazar going towards maligaon to reach Kamakhya Bus Stand. The fare is as cheap as RS 7 . Thereafter One need to get into a share cab or bus to reach the gate of the Temple. The cab costs 50 for one while the bus costs 10 for one.

I followed  the queue for Darshan, on enquiring, I was informed that we will reach Goddess Kamashya Devi for darshan in about 3 Hours. I took some snaps over there. Usual as at religious places, but in comparison things are cheaper, footwear care Rs5/-,, Bag care Rs10/- closer to temple. Restaurants are also cheaper, Rs7/- per Samosa. It was nice visit and memorable while returning I bought Bamboo wood articles viz. Hand fans, Trays, Table top etc. Return journey was more enjoyable:1) Temple Hill to Hill Bottom by Assam State Transport Bus Rs10/- (enjoyed Assam accents), 2)Hill Bottom to Adabari by Tempo service Rs10/-, 3) Took help of traffic police at Adabari to travel by shared Taxi Car from Adabari to Airport  Rs100/- ( Nice Traffic Man he was, hats off).\",\"there are frequent local buses to the base of the hilltop where the temple is located. you get a separate bus or taxi or shared taxi  from there. visiting kamakhya should be the first thing you do if you happen to be visiting Guwahati. the queue for darshan gets long, so keep some spare time.\",\"Steeped in mythology and the legend of Lord Shiva and Goddess Sati, the Kamakhya Temple is a very holy place.\\nIt's towards afternoon that the rush of pilgrims subsides a bit.

Plenty of buses are available from the city till the Kamakhya gate at the foothills. There are buses that directly ply till the hill top too.

Once we reach the place where cars are allowed, we have to walk for about 5 minutes to reach the temple. We have to walk on the road for a while. Then it is stairs all the way.\\n5. Shoes are allowed till the main gate of the mandir, which is after climbing the flight of stairs. There are many shops along the way that will say that the shoes are not allowed. That is to lure the pilgrims in keeping shoes at their shop and we end up purchasing the puja essential items from them. Same can be done at the shops near the entrance of the mandir.\\n5. It is a hassle-free mandir, where pandits don't really bother you. They will offer their help but won't press much. Many Pandits are there who will help you for the Pujas.\\n6. There are 2 entrance - one is the normal and the other is with a VIP entry ticket. The VIP ticket costs Rs. 501 while normal entry is free. The lines are managed very professionally and the inside of the mandir is also very comfortable as ACs are installed.\\n7.

l\"},{\"hoverinfo\":\"text\",\"hovertext\":[\"Temple is easily approachable with Uber or Ola, temple general que is quite crowded hence if you want to skip the same take Special Pass/ VIP ticket which costs 501 Rs and free for children aged less than 10 years. Carry your own water bottles as there won't be vendors selling the same. You can place the shoes and luggage for free near the Anna Prasad counter. Note that special que / VIP que doesn't operate between 12pm -3pm.\\n\\nOver all excellent divine power experience to the ones who visit here.\",\"It is one of the most important Dhams of Shakti. since there is a specific number of people who are allowed to be inside the temple sanctum, it is always better to reach there early. Even if you take the special pass, if you are late to arrive, you may miss the morning darshan. the inner sanctum does smell of blood from the offerrings by way of animal slaugther, Though Animal Slaughter has been stopped in almost all the temples in the country, in Kamakhya temple the same is still practised.\\n\\nIf you are not a Hindu they may not allow entry in the inner sanctum.\",\"Must not miss destination for all devotees. Very ancient temple and one of the shaktipeeth. The crowd starts from morning it self so one should be prepared for some waiting period which varies from day to day\",\"It's difficult to say anything because if you have the faith, this is among the most significant of all temples in India. The doors of the inner sanctum opens twice a day - 7 to 1 in the morning and 2.30 to 4.30 in the afternoon. Rest of time you can visit the temple and offer prayers from the outside. Fairly well maintained and clean.\",\"Reaching the Temple: I was staying in hotel near airport. It took more than an hour to book a uber or ola, because after accepting the trip, drivers cancelled trip. Local taxi were quoting very high (When landed in GAU Airport, even the pre-paid taxi counter charged 300 INR for just a 1km ride. Since we had luggage and kid, we had to budge to the pressure). It took 45min to reach temple\\n\\nTemple and it's surrounding:\\nToo much crowded, no proper traffic management, honking and rash driving all over. Each shop guys would call out loud and lure you to buy offerings for the temple. I saw most of them with greedy eyes and even had distasteful look at ladies. Very uncomfortable ambience.\\nThough there is lot of emphasis on cleanliness and swach campaigns, the whole place, road towards temple, inside the temple premises, toilets were all foul smelling and dirty.\\n\\nInside temple:\\nIf you don't book tickets in the morning, you have to go through a long que and wait for hours before you get darshan of deity. To take advantage of this crowded situation, there are greedy pandits who flock around you offering to show you deity, get you holy water, do pooja etc. They take you to one of the mandaps, ask for money, do some rituals for the sake of doing, and will rush you through before exiting.\\n\\nMy views:\\nTemples are sacred locations where each of the devotee should take extra care to maintain cleanliness, calm and serene atmosphere. I felt, in the name of devotion the temple turned into a market place filled with greed and treachery. It was painful to see the state of affairs. I pray to the Kamakhya Devi to remove the ignorance and greed in people and authorities to plan, and maintain order\\n\\nGuwahati was also not very conducive place to visit. Overall a bad experience to forget\\n\\nReturn:\\nAnother painstaking effort to find cab, all greedy taxi drivers waiting to extract money out of you. A very rash driver in maruti omni agreed for 450 INR to drop to hotel near airport\",\"Visited the temple late in the evening, during the Navratri week. Beautiful night time lighting and floral decorations on all the towers made it an awesome sight. The main deity access was closed, but the courtyard was buzzing with people. A walk up from the car park takes about 10 min. There are manned shelves to put away your shoes (Rs 5 per pair) before entry. Walking around the temple courtyard will take about 15 min. No charges for entering the temple compound.\",\"A must visit for all history gliders and religion intrigued people. Huge crowd  and devotees gather everyday making it impossible for a general tourist to visit it without being in the queue for minimum 3- 4 hrs. There is a special Rs 500 ticket available for a shorter queue. Impressive architecture makes the surrounding area a delight for all first time visitors.\",\"Go early here to avoid the queues.Its awesome and view from the top is really good.vip line is costly around 500 per person and general line is long\",\"There is a VIP line and a regular line, needless to say VIP is much faster moving. The temple has an aura about it. The shops outside sell souvenirs as well as religious items.\",\"It's a temple for the believers. If you have faith u must visit. Otherwise its not a touristy place. VIP pass for 500 bucks. That also has huge line. Normal entry line not worth mentioning. Make sure you have enough time in hand when coming here\",\"Unique temple for HIndu believers!  Located on top of a small hill.  Wating time could be about 90-120 mintues on most days. Quite crowded. Actual dharsahn time very short.\",\"The temple is situated at hills. Very traditional and old temple made of stones. The main \\\"Garbhgruh\\\" is very small. They allow in small lots. One has to be very patient in the queue.There are options of normal queue and paid queue. If you go early in the morning, not need to pay. Free queue won't be too long. Do see the view around the temple.\\nCars are not allowed till the door of temple. One has to walk a little.\",\"It is a beautiful temple although the crowd pouring has increased tremendously so the current management needs to figure out a way to manage the litter, the crowd and the queue system.\\n\\nWe took the Rs 500 ticket that promised less wait but realized it was a bad day and we had to still wait 2 hours! We also realized that the economy has evolved and everyone can now afford the Rs 500, so may be now for the Rs 1000 or the VIP line! It would get pretty hot and messy in summers!!\\n\\nThere is a line for everything here including the 12 noon free prasad lunch that goes all the way down to the stairs on the hill! We had to skip it.\",\"We had been there at around 9 am and reached back at around 12 pm. To sum it up,we got a VIP pass, waited for around 45 mins in a room. The management of queue was good. As soon as our number came we got entry in another 2 hours. I would suggest to visit the place only if you are strong believer or a devotee. Otherwise this temple could be avoided. Another problem, is that the temple still continues its ritual of bali with pigeons, goats etc. Fortunately, i did not go to that part of temple.\",\"A must place to visit when you visit the Northeast part of India. Great belief for Hindus and a great place to enjoy the bliss of nature and art. The temple is beautifully built. The general line took 8 hours on Saturday. Usually it takes 4 hours. If you are visiting with children or elderly person, then take the Rs. 500 pass per head. This will save them.\",\"Don't miss this very sacred temple. We didn't go inside as the queues were at least 5 hours long as Pilgrims start queueing at daybreak, but just to walk around and soak up the atmosphere was a very moving experience.\",\"...Yeah that's what you're in for...despite the Rs.501/- ticket you bought! The queues can run long and if they do ..I am sorry ..but, you put yourself there :) May be the sanctum sanctorum will alleviate your pain...just may be! But, if you are a competitive pilgrim...good luck!\",\"From the point of view of a normal person, a good place for a time pass. I was insisted to visit this place with my friends, roaming around at the temple premises when others were worshiping. Nice to have a stroll, to look around ponds, the wooden frames for sacrificing animals, and watching others to praying with strong belief.\\n\\nThe two things I would like to mention: First is the special queue. One needs to spend 500 bucks per person to stand on the smaller queue. Which is expensive when you visit with your whole family and children. Second is the presence of monkeys. They tend to rob any food item from your hands. be aware of them.\",\"This is quite a famous temple and was very crowded when we visited. Entry into the inner sanctum will take anywhere between 2-3 hours (depending on the ticket type). Overall, it is worth a visit but if you wish to enter the inner areas, then plan for 2-3 hours of time at the minimum\",\"Truely spiritual experience. It's fine once you get past the numerous vendors. We did a prayer with a priest here and unlike other places he didn't demand money. There are long queues so good to get there early. The temple area is kept clean.\\nBeautiful spiritual experience.\",\"Generally I am quite hesitant to go to any of the long queue temple. This was well managed and we peacefully entered the main shrine in line and came out. Since we took help of one local, the priest also did not haggle on money. Hence for me, the experience was good. Another good point was that they allow you to stay inside main shrine for a couple of minutes and do not push you out unlike some other temples\",\"I wanted to see this temple as I have heard it is one of the Shakti-Peeths. Yes indeed it does seem like some sort of power/spirit it residing inside. It is hard to believe such things but I am sure there must be some scientific explanation to it as well. Your head starts to become heavy and you start feeling tired suddenly when you go inside the temple. The experiences with people vary but something you will definitely fee. When you enter inside the actual temple it is very damp in there and the smoke from the havans and agarbatti's are all around. The temple has rocky base and hard rocky steps with lot of crowd in it. Despite following the queue you will end up colliding and brushing against each other at the real spot.\\n\\nBeware of the priests of the temple. They are like give money here and the Goddess will shower wealth on you. Inside the same temple at different places there are different priests and each one of them demands their own set of share. Its totally your choice on how much you want to spend inside the temple and where you want to do so. The priests are very greedy, till the time you are not giving they say give whatever you wish but as soon as you give something they start asking more. For eg. if you give Rs 51, they say, \\\"arre beta give Rs 501 and Devi Maa will give you more!\\\" I was really amazed to see this kind of attitude inside the temple. So I advise you all should be careful.\\n\\nPlease check the timings of the temple for visitors before you go as they keep on changing with season to season. If you go so far and do not make it, then it really feels sad.\",\"the complex is quaint and nice.\\nit is a 4 km walk up from the main road and a small eatery on the way served among the best tea i had in a long time.\\n\\nthe temple rules are funny,\\nthey issued a 501 rupee ticket at 10... and we had to wait till 1.30 for the main deity doors to open..\\nvery funny... no one seems to know when the main doors will open..!!\",\"A very nice temple with divinity pouring in from the deity in the form of vibrations felt by me and before i could decide whether it was true or imaginary, the same divine vibratory effect has been felt by another devotee from Hyderabad who seemed to be highly educated standing next to me and one may have to experience the same by visiting the temple to believe it to be true.Crowd management can be done in a better way and have 1 or 2 entrances instead of multiple queues and the crowd be given atleast a couple of minutes to sit peacefully and pray.\",\"The temple is normally very crowded I understand. If you are not keen on crowds, abstain from visiting on an auspicious day. When you find the queue to be long, you can go to an entrance (I think gate # 5) from where you can see the deity and offer your prayers and can skip the queue.\\n\\nParking near the temple is an issue.\",\"Its quite important temple in Nilachal Hills, it remains quite crowded so had to go early at 4 yet we had to wait for long hours.\",\"the q system has improved from my last visit 3 years before. Much cleaner this time. More systematic but still the priority pass counter timing are not followed properly.\",\"You have to stand in the queue for 4-5 hours until you are not taking VIP pass of INR 300-500. On Saturday, it is more crowded because Maa Kali is worshipped on saturday.\",\"I didn't actually go in. I didn't want to stand in line for 1.5 hours and I didn't want to pay 500 rupees to fast track my way in. I went around the temple, saw atavistic figures and lots of vermilion streaked pigeons and goats. And then I went my own way.\",\"Visited in the early hours but very rush and many pilgrims. Que is very long, there is vip line for 500 bucks. Felt happy and blessed after the visit.\",\"This temple is one of the popular in India. There are no misbehavior from the temple's working peoples. I have to wait almost 4 hours to get inside the hotel. VIP pass available on counter.\",\"Temple Timings: Daily from 0800 hrs to 1300 hrs and then from 1430 hrs to 1730 hrs. To avoid rush, better to visit in the afternoon.\\n\\nDifferent Entry Queues are as following:\\n1. General Entry: It is free of cost. But the queue starts in the early morning normally from 0500 hrs, on auspicious days from 0300 hrs\\nDirect Entry: Available at the cost of INR 501 per person. This ticket entitles us a separate queue close to the main sanctum.\",\"It is a good experience in rain. Rs.500 is to be paid to shorten queue. It is just waste of time. Nothing is in side the temple. There is not disaster management. To visit outside is enough.\",\"This temple is situated on a hill. The temple is well maintained and disciplined. Temple is neat and clean also. People have to stand and sometime sitting down a lot in queue for more than 5 hours at least.

Also the legend behind this temple was good to know about through Wikipedia. There was a long queue for worshippers to get into the temple, so we skipped it. There was also a marriage procession happening in the temple premises, which was amusing. The complex area with the fountains is a peaceful area to just sit and relax. We visited because it was famous, and came out observing something new in a temple. Don't forget to take your taxi all the way up to the temple and not just the gate on the main road at the bottom of the hill. Good to visit once if you are a tourist.\",\"Nice place but bad part was killing of animal like Buffalo pigeon fish extremely bad...killing animal is not wanted by god.\",\"Good temple, but killing animals by devotees was not at good thing, so personally I didn't like such places\",\"This temple up in the hills was an interesting building with fun statues.

As a place where animal sacrifice is done, have chosen never to go in.\",\"Located of a hill, the temple is quite large and has some nice ancient buildings, but moderns cage-like corridors have been added to accommodate the crowds of visitors. Interesting to witness animal sacrifices (people bring pigeons and goats).\",\"I swear I will never go to this temple again. I hate crowded areas and that's one of the reason. I never knew that there is still a place in India where animal sacrifice is permitted. Seeing lots of goats being sacrificed, blood all over the floor, standing in queue for hours, corrupt pujaris, stupid pigeon seller who treat beautiful birds like a thing and not a creature. These all bad experiences make it a place not to visit again. I am a religious person but I am a human being first.\",\"This temple is situated on the hill near Guahati. We engaged a Taxi and went to the temple. It takes about 35 minutes to reach the temple based on the traffic. Since I had been already warned by the reviews I had seen on the trip advisor, I was cautious about the Priests or their agents and did not engage any of them. At the same time, I found that Queue was too long and not moving we decided to worship and pray from just outside the sanctum of the main temple structure.\\n\\nThere are shops selling pooja and other items inside the temple complex.( Photos attached) This Deity is said to be very powerful and devotees are thronging in big way with their families. I could see some had brought animals for sacrifice.\",\"This is one of the very important of 52 Shakti Pithas, the most sacred places of the Divine Mother, for the Hindus. It's on the highest mount in Guwahati, a traditional Tantra seat of learning, but now has lost that Tantra touch. However, it feels the divine presence of the Mother once you're there. The sacrifice of goats and buffaloes are still offered in open. The weak in heart should not dare to see this ritual! Some devotees free pigeons in the air as an alternative of the sacrifice. You have to wait in the queue for at least 2 hours any day; hence try to visit the temple in early hours. A special taxi takes Rs 100 to ferry you from the main road upto the temple; the shared taxis only Rs 10. There is a small water pool too where it is mandatory to offer worship to Ganesha. In annakshetra, one can have a free meal prasad too.\\nIt feels great being here.\",\"This is the most important temple in the Tantric religion and beliefs, and it sits above Guwahati city on a hill with a road that winds upwards to the heavens to reach it. It has a really quite special and powerful feel to the place and I sat for a long while outside just soaking up the atmosphere and watching the comings and goings of the worshippers, as well as the plethora of animals and birds there. Unfortunately I heard that these animals (mostly goats, sheep and doves) were destined for sacrifice which is something I can't condone and did not want to see anyway, though I understand it's been part of the tradition of the place for many years. Hopefully this facet of the temple will change with time and be found unnecessary as a part of worship but it's something to bear in mind if you visit there...that you may see or hear this going on and may find it disturbing. Beyond that aspect of the place it is a huge and truly beautiful place with carved pillars and areas for lighting candles as well as inner recesses for giving offerings and receiving blessings, though you have to queue for such in organised wire netted corridors. Very atmospheric place, and I felt the heaviness of the spirituality weighing on me here....\",\"I had the misfortune to go to this temple as part of an excursion with about 20 other people ( all nationalities). We were warned by our guide ,after we arrived, that there was animal sacrifice at this temple...EVEN THOUGH THIS IS AN ILLEGAL PRACTICE.\\nI foolishly thought that perhaps just the one poor animal would be killed , little did I know that it was wholesale slaughter just one after another..\\nUpon entering the site, I saw the cutest little tiny goat just playing around.We all took photos only to see to our horror, this poor creature being dragged at the end of a rope, taken to \\\" the area\\\" were it struggled to escape and screamed a scream I still hear in my sleep..It truly was horrific..\\nThen to see a man walk past me with a carry bag carelessly dripping blood onto the ground that we all walked on..I then realised that this was this defenseless little goat.\\nI saw people carrying pidgeons just by their wings..So callous.\\nI would just ask that some care and thought be given to these poor animals who gave up their lives for some misguided wish or thanks..\\nThese prayers must not be working because you've just got to look around at the filth, squalor and poverty...\\nPlease don't bother haranging me about my opinions, I don't really care about your religion,culture etc..Find a more humane way to worship your gods , Many many religions manage to do this and their followers are still happy..\\nI, an all that I travelled with were distressed, and other visitors here were also..\\nI WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE..\",\"This Shakti Peeth finds reference in the ancient epic Mahabharat. It is situated on top of a hill around 25 km from airport. One needs a private vehicle/ taxi to reach there. Vehicle takes you right upto the temple. Not much walking or climbing of stairs is involved. Special arrangements on payment, are there for handicapped. We visited in the afternoon. Tookt a VIP ticket for Rs 501/-. It took us about 45 minutes to reach the sanctum. General que was quite long and appeared heldup. Final about 10 meters, the passage is narrow and dimly lit. Few slippery steps take you down to the deity (pindi), in a small pool of water. You are permitted to touch the pindi and sprinkle holy water. Very satisfying experience.\\n\\nAnimal sacrifice is prevalent. Do visit a Ganesh temple, within the complex.\",\"The temple is of immense significance according to Hindu tradition. It can accessed by a ride up the hill but had decent parking facilities. We visited in the afternoon and lucky to have hardly any rush. Sanctum sanctorum was also empty but have heard that there are huge queues in the morning. Its an old temple made completely out of stone. The steps, corridors, verandah etc. are all cut out of stone and hence gives it ancient look. Hence, it is a nice experience.It is also famous for goat sacrifice and we could spot a goat head near the main idol. However, it is not necessary to witness the sacrifice.For religious purposes, one can visit it if in Assam.\",\"I am not very religious but I still made sure to go to Kamakhya temple after reading the reviews. This has an interesting shape (unlike the south or northern temples). I was initially surprised to see many goats and pigeons inside the temple premise. I also heard about the animal sacrifice during festivals. We visited the in the evening (after sunset) and missed to see the city landscape and the Brahmaputra river from the hill. It was worth the visit.\",\"A great temple I had visited with my family. Got down at the bus stop and took a cab that took me to the temple. The roads were pretty twisted and the scene outside the cab was breathtaking.\\nFinally, After going to the temple I purchased tickets being sold through a very tiny temple.\\nThe temple was built in a dark underground cave-like place. There is no idol of the goddess in the temple.\\nBe sure to check out the handicrafts sold outside the temple.\\n(Be warned if looking blood is not really your thing as lots of animal sacrifices are performed in the temple)\",\"The Kamakya Temple is- so to say - a bloody temple. A wonderful place to stroll around. On special days it can be very crowded and the people are launched through high gates to the temple's court. On these days there are mass offerings. Visitors bring young goats, pigeon and other animals they love and meant to be offered. This is done by beheading and certainly not for the faint hearted. This ritual was also done with a young male buffelo. The guy beheaded the buffalo with a sword in one swing. All done ritually and the head was carried into the temple. Sounds all brutal, but a tradition which we were very content and proud to be part of.\",\"One of the most famous temple of North East... worth a visit.. perched on a hill top. Beautiful and peaceful.\\n\\nOnly thing i did not like was that i heard the temple still sacrifices animals to please the deity. i did see the sacrificing area :(\",\"We started our north east trip from Guwahati. Since all were coming from different places, we decided to meet at Kamkhya temple. All of is had heard about the temple but no one knew what was waiting inside.\\n\\nWe stood in line to visit the main temple but then gave up as the line was too large. We took a large round around the sanctum and came at this corner place where people were shouting. Looking closely, we saw animals - sparrow, bull etc being sacrificed and then their head taken in the inner sanctum of the temple. I must say i am scarred for life. I never expected to see this in a temple but overall a very different experience.\",\"Its a huge temple at Guwahati where there is a lot of animal sacrifice which happens -- Goats, pigeons , etc.\\nWhile the temple itself is beautiful , it sure is a bit terrifying when you see Goats and Birds being given up for sacrifice. Thankfully avoided going to the place where the sacrifices are done.\",\"An important shiva temple. There is general queue which take long time. there another which cost Rs 500 which is faster. Here animal sacrifice is still practiced.\",\"A winding, scenic road leads up to the hill-top temple of the mother goddess, Kamakhya. From the parking lot, one has to climb a flight of steps dotted with souvenir shops to reach the entrance. I visited the temple on a quiet afternoon and found the precinct to be fairly clean and  free of hubbub or pestering pandyas. Goats, monkeys and pigeons were present in the courtyard; but mercifully there were no signs of animal sacrifice which I believe is a common practice here. I did not enter the temple itself as there was a long queue and privileged access required a payment of Rs. 501 - an amount I would rather spend on a good book. My friend who did shell out that sum and entered the temple, seemed crestfallen on her return as the Yoni (representing the goddess) in the sanctum was mostly covered up. I enjoyed going around the courtyard looking at sundry shrines and idols. Also saw stunning panoramic views of the surrounding landscape from a location just beyond the (avoidable) toilet block. NB: After climbing down the flight of steps, one can find a few restaurants which are OK for a quick meal/snack.\",\"We had reached the must visit temple in Guwahati and approached the information centre who had told that the temple has two lines VIP (Rs 501 per person) and General (free). We decided to take the general route to as the temple entrance and area didn't look busy at all... After walking till gate 5 we were made to sit and wait hour and half. Till the next holding. Our trip started at arrival to temple at 0930hrs till visit the shrine at 1330 hrs. The temple authorities lock the general gates for hours till other with VIP access get served.\\nFor animal lovers this place has kid (baby goat) sacrificial area which is visible while awaiting in general queue and found that utterly disappointing in this age to hear the shrieking goat.\\n\\nThis is my opinion and doesn't serve to hurt any other religious sentimental people or offend them.\\n\\nMy advise is that you can go directly towards main entrance from the left side of temple and see the shrine for no fee and without hassles.\",\"As per Hindu Mythology This is one of the Shakti peeth ,specially known for \\\"Tantra\\\".\\nTemple is situated at Hill of Nilanchal and now temple is approachable via roads upto near mandir.\\nTough to pray in this Temple\\nSimple normal Line and Sp.

The queue is invariably long, the temple opens at 8am and closes at 4:45 pm, with a luch break too, when no darshan is allowed. Bali/ sacrifice is performed at the temple and the offered heads of goats/ Buffaloes may be seen. Some people just free the animals instead of sacrifice, so goats/ Buffaloes / pigeons are found wandering around. It's a great to sit and meditate anywhere in the premises.\",\"This temple is known for sacrifice of anumals. I dont support this tradition & hence do not recommened it. For the god fearing its a must do. As a tourist its avoidable.\",\"The place is crowded and long queues as most religious sites in India. Did not enjoy the place much after seeing goats getting dragged to the butcher for sacrifice at the temple. Lets become rational and stop such cruelty to animals. Go vegetarian!\",\"The Temple is sittuated on the hills in Guwahati. 5 mins walk required to reach the temple premises. Bags not allowed. Only wallets and purse can be taken inside the temple. It is an ancient temple. we were told that animal sacrifice is a common practise here. you can see several pigeons and lambs all around and even within the temple premises.\\nThere was a long queue like usual to visit inside which would take good 2-3 hours, hence we settled only for Mukh Darshan. VIP passes are also available.\",\"Okay this might offend some people as this is like the tirupati of north east but the point is this.They kill birds and animals in that campus as on 'offering' to god.You can see goat calfs tied on the railing and just outside the temple opening are small roofless cabins in which they execute them,all is visible from the high stairs on the left.As a jain i find this DEEPLY OFFENSIVE.If you have small children,you dont want to show them such violence and be around it yourself either.This place must be boycotted so that they run out of business and cant buy goats n pigeons to execute.Do your bit,share this review,tell people who go to guwahati abt it and dont go there Urself.I beg you to not.\",\"This temple is known for animal sacrifices so we were vary of going there but we did attempt. The temple itself is beautiful, well maintained but the smell of blood, pigeon poop and traditional incense makes it a bit difficult to enjoy the temple itself. A quick visit to see the Goddess is a great idea.\",\"Temple is on a hillock, and you can take a shared autoriksha to climb. Better to avoid special occasions to avoid crowd. You can take special entry by paying Rs.500. Around the temple you can see wounded pigeons, which were offered (blood) to goddess.  Animal sacrifice is common and if you are not comfortable with that avoid going to neighbouring temples\",\"Being a couple from Holland, this Temple is a must see. We hired an Uber taxi and arrived around 11 AM. It was too late and crowded to get a ticket for the inside of the Temple and the free row would have taken us hours. But what a nice experience to walk between the devotees, see the sacrife of lambs and pigeons and engage with several families. There are many shops, so this is the place to buy your souvenirs.\",\"This is the main Shakti Peeth and has a great story behind it. The temple situated on top of a hill is little walk from the parking. Once again I was totally amazed with the cleanliness given the fact that goats and Bulls are sacrificed here. Best time to reach the temple is by 6 am and take the 500 rs VIP pass to enter. If you miss this, then there is a long queue to enter the temple and can take hours. Kids are allowed to enter any time. There is no idol in the time, but Goddess Yoni which secretes Ganga Water which is to be worshipped. The temple is shut 3 days a year when bleeding happens... The priests at the temple are also helpful, though some you should beware of... Overall again a Divine Experience...\",\"Too much blood is all i can say. Tough for animal lovers. Couldnt bear to see slashed animals and birds left to die.\\nTook away from the significance of the place.\",\"The first thing that struck me was that good Samaritans paid a price to remove pigeons from captivity.  The happy pigeons rushed into the skies and if they we understood their language we would have discerned their extreme gratitude.  This is a temple with so much legend.  Lord Shiva and his wife Goddess Sati are associated with this temple.  The temple commemorates this Hindu Goddess. She is also known as Sodashi locally.The devotion here is palpable.  I saw so many sadhus walking up the stairs in a trance to offer worship in the sanctum sanctorum.  I took a taxi from Guwahati and after 8 kms we reached foothills of Nilanchal Hill, atop which the temple is perched.\",\"Animal sacrifice takes place at this Temple if you are an animal lover or vegetarian then probably this is not the temple for you. If you are wondering why there are so many pigeons and goats around then the explanation is a tad dasterdly..... It's pretty much animal sacrifice\",\"Nestled in the bustling city of India's gateway to the east - Guwahati, this epoch seat of tantric power holds you and then enfolds you, leaving you feeling released \\u2026 free.  Despite the vast numbers that continuously pour in and out of its folds, you can sense inner calm and become aware of two diverse experiences - energy and peace - overflowing you at the same time.The roughly two hour journey to its sanctum sanctorum (much shorter on weekdays, except for on festive occasions), can be a memorable spiritual affair, something that you may owe yourself.  While this is a place where animal sacrifice is practiced, the area is tucked away deep inside, far from view.  My visit during the afternoon was free from this facet.  All my apprehensions of seeing/ hearing sounds of animals were allayed, and I was overwhelmed by the immense Shakti (power) of the sacred precincts.  A must visit place, with your family and friends.\",\"i will advise people to be ready for some ghasty scenes if u r not a supporter of animal sacrifice. but if you r a staunch worshipper.....this place may attract u a lot. please keep in mind that u can have a quick darshan if you buy a special coupon. it is available at rs 100 n 500. the architecture is very nice and while coming down to guwahti town.....u can see the entire city from a view hut.\",\"Full of pigeons, goats and situated at a peak, Kamakhaya temple is a worth visiting place. Animal sacrifice is given to Lord Shiva on few days of the week. The priests ask for money for a quick Darshan. Ancient temple, thought of having rich religious value as few body parts of Mata Sati are believed to be fallen here. Many believe that worshiping at here provides Moksha.\",\"The dark and true face of the 'India Shining' community is bluntly evident over here. Animals and birds are ruthlessly offered in open in the name of God at a shockingly brisk pace. The long and stagnant queues provide a horrific show of these gruesome killings. The visit made me sick from inside and further strengthened my disbelief in the belief to believe in God.\\n\\nVisit at your own risk.\",\"I came here long time back when I was a school going kid. Yet I seem to remember those thousands of pigeons sitting on the dome of the mandir. I am not much of a religious person, but this Mandir is very famous and is related to history in Mahabharata.\",\"A soul enriching experience when paying regards to Ma Kamakhya Devi.\\nThough shocked to see the ongoing brutal killing of animals for Bali.\\nI used to think that Bali had been banned in India but seems I was mistaken as Bali Pratha continues in the temple. Please stop the Bali Pratha and save the animals.\",\"As temples go this is an ancient temple where human sacrifice as done in the olden days. In these times,goats an buffaloes are still sacrificed. The sanctum sanctorum is a dark place accessible by steps going down. People are crowded cheek by jowl and the Pandas want you to give money everywhere. once you are in, your only feeling is to get out as fast as possible.\",\"The place is disgusting, not because the priests run around like salesman, attacking every vehicle entering the premises, nor because they(certainly without regard to cleanliness) spit on the roads and walk on their own spit with bare feet but, because they perform animal sacrifices in the temple premises.\\nThough Indian law bans animal sacrifices, it apparently isn't followed here. Why would any god/goddess bless when you sacrifice(when the animal itself doesn't want to sacrificed) an innocent animal I cannot comprehend. Leaving the legal part and personal opinion for animal sacrifice out of this review, I wouldn't suggest this place to any traveller, who have any regard for cleanliness and have some respect for animals. Definitely not for kids(inappropriate age), pregnant women, weak hearted.\\n(PS: I saw heads of two tiny calves kept on a plate and taken into the temple and another made ready for the sacrifice, it's cry still reverberates in my ears)\",\"This temple has an important past and people from remote parts of country visit here,Overall the temple is situated in large area to handle loads of devotees.The location where it is situated is on a hill so one can get a soothing view from the temple,But something that drew me out of the temple too early was the smell of goats roaming freely in the temple premise,yes we asked people the reason for such large population of goats there and came to know that these are either rescued from different places and set free here,or are used for offering BALI in the temple.Otherwise the temple has an excellent atmosphere.And you will find stuffs made of wood (bamboo) at the shops here\",\"Pandits are busy asking for donations everywhere. Lots of lambs seen venturing around. This is place is known to make lambs' sacrifice. Heard they even give blood of the sacrifice as prasadam!\\nTypical busy, famous temple- long queues, dirty, money drive...\",\"A spiritual and divine place.

It may be divine for such medieval minded \\\"religious\\\" people but for me it is a sinful place. Just could not bear the stench and bleating of goats. Really, how can God reside here? My request to people, if you are human beings then please stop visiting this place so that the slaughter stops. This is blind superstition, nothing else. It is risky as well because it is is unhygenic.\",\"The temple and its surrounding temples of the Dasa Mahavidyas are vibrant with spiritual energy.  The only saddening aspect of the atmosphere there is the rows of goats, cows and wicker baskets of pigeons patiently waiting to be sacrificed in the sacrificial hall (on the premises) adjacent to the main temple.   The understanding is that the meat of the sacrificed animals is distributed as prasad to the surrounding poor families residing in the villages.  An alternative prasad of whole grains and rice including vegetables instead can be distributed daily as Devi Kamakhya temples abounds in wealth given by the devout pilgrims.  It is an age old tradition to sacrifice animals but there is no need for this cruelty.  Even they have a life and if we do not have the power to give life except Devi Maata then how can we think we are entitled to take a life?  Devi Maata is pleased even if we offer a simple flower with devotion.  The element of Devotion and Bhakti is important, not whether we are sacrificing an animal to please her.\",\"This was in my \\\"Must Visit\\\" list but I must confess I was a bit disappointed with the number of goats in the temple premises, monkeys who were snatching the Prasad....\\n\\nPositives - did not have to wait too long in the afternoon....found a Pujari easily to do the puja...\",\"Heard a lot about the famous Kamakhya temple; but my experience was not a pleasant one.\\n\\nThe temple complex is huge and there are other temples close to the Kamakhya temple.

The temple is on a hill close to the shore of the Brahmaputra river and was built in reverence to the Goddess Sati and the occult is still practiced there. It has  seven oval spires and inside one daily animal, generally goat, sacrifices are made. We were forewarned before we went in so that we could avoid seeing anything we didn't want to.  One goat sacrifice had just taken place and the animal was being skinned and jointed and the meat would be given to the people. As it was Sunday the whole area was very very crowded and very noisy and colourful. One particular temple is where the locals worship to bring fertility to the family and there was a massive queue of four to five hours to go in.\",\"The temple at kamakhya and its sacredness aong the hindus can be realized from the fact that tens of thousands of devotees come here every year including the Aghori sadhus.The temple is also one of the best example  which displays both the architect as  well as the devotion of the Ahoms.The only thing which i found should be stopped is the useless sacrifice of animals.....\",\"this temple is situated at the top of nilachal hill.it is an important pilgrimage destination for Hindus and Tantric worshipers. apart from the main temple there are temples dedicated to different forms of the mother godness such as Ma Kali, Bagala,Tara,Chinnamasta,Bhuvaneswari,Bhairavi,Dhumavati,five temples dedicated to Lord Shiva and three temples to Lord Vishnu.there are other temples of various goddess too\\nTemple timings-8am to 1pm again 2.30 pm onwards.\\nImportant festivals-Ambubachi,Durga puja,Shiva ratri,Manasa puja.\\nWe went there around 3pm.it was not that crowded at that time.we took VIP tickets for Rs500.we completed our darshan within 1hr.animal sacrifice is very common here.\\nIn the morning it is v.crowded .many devotees come here carrying goats with them for sacrificing.pandits are polite.everything done here in a systematic way.\",\"The temple and the roads leading up to it were heaving with people and very good for people photos.

This is one of the few temples where Animal sacrifice is still prevelant. Built upon a small hillock in Gauhati, it is must visit for everyone travelling to North East India and we did same. Long queue of devotees are always there and it is relatively easier to have Darshan in the post lunch session.\",\"Once in Guwahati, the Kamakhya Temple is a must visit. Nestled atop a hill with picturesque views, it is believed to be a very powerful temple with massive crowds thronging the temple for darshan. I visited it during the lunch hour, so the main temple was closed and it was less crowded.\\n\\nOnce atop the hill, you will see a line of shops selling pooja items and prasad. On entering the temple, you will see lambs, pigeons, etc., some of them marked in red (mostly ready for sacrifice). You do experience some sort of power here, hence the immense following. I was told that the sacrifice takes place in the evenings during the aarti. After a quick darshan from the outside (as it was lunch hour), I made my way out. The views on the way downhill are very picturesque and worth stopping by for a few quiet moments and clicks.\\n\\nNote that taxi drivers (Uber/Ola) get you to the top, but it is difficult to book cabs for your return, so you may have to use local autos till you reach the main road.\",\"Shakti peeth of Assam is a must visit.. this 8th century temple is a   abode of faith.. the animal sacrifice is still carrying on at this place\",\"A beautiful experience it was... an experience like none other.. The  temple does not have an idol and has a stone like formation in the Garbha Graha. It has a separate section for conducting sacrifices of animals which could be slightly disturbing to those who are not used to the concept of sacrifices. One of my friends were disturbed seeing the head of goat (that was sacrificed earlier) kept inside the garbha griha.

We some how understood they are going to sacrifice the pigeon in name of god. Then we came through the area were several goats were tied up having sindoor on them again got to know its for d goddess to sacrifice there blood. Finally when we entered the temple I had held my heart tight and almost tears in my eyes when I saw the entire floor red which was the color of the blood of the sacrificed animals and some vessels kept to fill in the blood.

Having heard lots of mysterious stories about Devi Kamakhya temple we were very curious to come here and this was also our main purpose of the tour. The temple is dedicated  to Mother goddess Kali. The mythological story behind the establishment of the temple is that when Lord Shiva came to know that his wife Parvati had jumped into fire because of insult to her husband by her father, he got infuriated and started dancing with her body. Her body parts started falling here and there and those places became temples of goddess,  revered as Shakti Peeths (Sacred power centers). One of the part, the reproductive organ is believed to have fallen here and so Kamakhya Devi (after the name of Kamrup region) temple is rated as a very powerful shakti peeth and also visited by tantriks (mystics) from all over India who indulge in mysticism and sorcery also on some particular day. Probably, this is the only temple in India where sacrifice of goats is still done on some occasions to fulfill one's desire. What I liked most about the temple is its cleanliness and good maintenance besides location on a hillock overlooking the city of Guwahati. We were advised to avoid Tuesdays, and weekends because of heavy rush and so visited it on Wednesday. Even then there were many people and it took us about 2 hours to have darshan without payment. By paying 500/- we could have completed the visit in just 1 hour without waiting in line. The payment could probably be useful on heavily crowded days. The other great attraction of this temple is that the priests do not harass you by asking extra money and whatever one feels like donating he can put it in hundis (lockers) kept at many places in the temple. We had great contented feeling after completing the temple visit. The whole temple campus is superb and outside there are many restaurants and shops selling religious items, sweets etc. A Must visit temple for all Hindus and even for non-Hindus because of its great location and surroundings.

This temple is located in Neelanchal hill which is about 8 kilometers away from the centre of Guwahati town. Kamakhya temple is on the spot where Goddess Sati's female reproductive part had fallen after it was cut by Lord Vishnu's chakra.  This temple has no idol. The temple has a holy spring of water and a form of Sati's body part which is worshipped.\",\"The temple is also called Nilachal temple and consists of four chambers i.e. garbhagriha and three mandapas locally called calanta, pancharatna and natamandira aligned from east to west. The temple denotes the spot where Sati used to retire in secret to satisfy her amour with Shiva, and it was also the place where her yoni fell after Shiva danced with the corpse of Sati. As per Hindu belief Tirtha Yatra remains incomplete unless Kamakhya is not visited. The present Government has taken sincere initiative to connect Kamakhya with all places in India.\",\"The temple is situated a few kilometers away from the Guwahati Railway Station, and is open for visitors throughout the year. The exact date of the original temple is not known. It is believed that, the temple is an ancient temple. The Temple was rebuilt in 1665, after being destroyed by Muslim invaders. It was probably an ancient Khasi sacrificial site, sacrifices are still very much part of worship here. Group of devotees arrive each morning with goats to offer to Shakti. Although little is known about the early history of the temple, the first reference to the place has been traced back to the Allahabad inscriptions of Emperor Samudragupta.\\n\\nThere is a legend attached to the history of the temple, which goes way back to the mythological age. According to the legend, Sati the wife of Lord Shiva (one of the holy Trinities in Hindu mythology) took her life at a `Yagna` ceremony that had been organized by her father Daksha, because she could not bear the insults hurled at her husband by her father. On hearing the news of his wife`s death, Shiva, the destroyer of all that was evil flew into a rage and punished Daksha by replacing his head with that of a goat. Torn between misery and blind fury, Shiva picked up the corpse of his beloved wife Sati and performed a dance of destruction called the `Tandava`.\\n\\nThe Kalika Purana, an ancient work in Sanskrit describes Kamakhya as the yielder of all desires, the young bride of Shiva, and the giver of salvation. Shakti is known as Kamakhya. The Kamakhya Temple, which is situated high up on a hill called Neelachal Parbat or Kamagiri in the city of Guwahati, is one of its several religious landmarks, which speaks volumes about the rich historical treasure over which the state of Assam is settled. This sacred temple in the heart of the capital city of Assam holds more than it meets the eye of the spectator. The Kamakhya Temple had been built in admiration to Goddess Kamakhya or Sati, who was one of the numerous incarnations of Goddess Durga or Goddess Shakti.\",\"The moment I thought of Kamakhya I thought it is a temple dedicated to Mother Goddess Parvathi in the name of Kamakhya. When I landed at the Kamakhya temple at Guwahati, I wanted to know the stala purana, means the story of the place. This is what I do first wherever I go. I have read the mythological story of Daksha son of Lord Brahma. Daksha had 28 daughters. His first daughter Sathi fell in love with Lord Shiva and went away with Him to Kailasa, against the wishes of her father. Planet Chandra (Moon) married all the other 27 daughters of Daksha. Being pleased with the obedience of 27 daughters Daksha blessed them to be the permanent stars glittering always on the sky. That is how there are 27 stars in Hindu astrology. On the advice of father Brahma, Daksha under took to perform Yagna for the good of the universe. He invited all the gods, except Shiva and Sathi, to attend the function. Sathi wanted to attend the function though not invited. She pestered her husband Shiva to permit her to attend the function. Without waiting for his nod she went away to her parents\\u2019 home. Daksha not only scolded Sathi but also insulted Shiva using low language. Enraged with utter disappointment and unbearable insult she jumped into the sacrificing fire and committed suicide. Up to this point the story, as I know, is OK.\\n\\nThe astonishing feature of the story as well as the cause for the Kamakhya is this: On the death of Sathi, Shiva sends Virabhadra and Kali along with all Shivaganas to kill Daksha and they did so. Lord Vishnu cuts off the dead body of Sathi from His disk into 108 pieces and scattered them over the earth. All those 108 places wherever the pieces fell are considered as Shakthi Peetas in India. Among them 51 are more powerful again among those 51, Kamakhya is more dominant power-driven place. It is, according to the story, because the \\u2018Yoni\\u2019 of Sathi had fallen in this place. But what is this Yoni. \\u2018Yoni\\u2019 means vagina/vulva. That is where I was shocked to know the story of the place.\\n\\nThe main deity in Kamakhya Temple is mother goddess Kamakhya. It is said to be one of the oldest of the 51 Pitas Situated on the Nilachal Hill in western part of Guwahati city in Assam, India. This temple houses other ten individual shrines called Mahavidyas within its compound. They are Bhuvaneshvari, Bagalamukhi, Chinnamasta, Tripura Sundari, Thara, Kali, Bhairavi, Dhumavati, Matangi and Kamala.\\n\\nThe temple is said to be of 8th century and moderated by the rulers from time to time and the present one is of 17th century. It is titled as\\u2019 in the Nilachal type\\u2019. This temple is in hemispherical dome on a cruciform base. There are four chambers namely garbhagriha and three mandapas, which are called by local name as Calanta, Pancaratna and Natamandira aligned from east to west.\\n\\nThe main deity is not like an idol as we see generally in all Hindu temples. The Garbhagriha is the sanctum sanctorum of the temple. It is below ground level. There is no icon but a rock is found split in the shape of a yoni. It is tiny, dark space that can be reached by narrow steep stone steps. There I saw a sheet of stone sloping down from both sides and leads to the spot of yoni-like shaped portion of about 10 inches deep. The yoni portion is the sacred and holy symbol of Mother Kamakhya. This yoni is always filled with water as there is an underground permanent spring. This yoni, that is the vulva-shaped spot, is worshiped as the Mother Goddess Kamakhya. It is familiarly known as the most important pitha (abode) of the Goddess.\\n\\nHere, as I saw, two types of worshippers of the goddess. One is Vamachara (Left-Hand Path) and the second is Dakshinachara (Right-Hand Path). Those who want to acquire Tantric vidya they worship in Vamachara (Left-Hand Path) method whereas the others worship in Dakshinachara (Right-Hand Path) system. The apparent difference is the former offer Bali, means sacrificing sheep, goat etc whom I say non-veg devotees and the latter offer only sweets to the goddess, I call them vegetarian devotees. The wonderful speciality is female animals are exempt from sacrifice, probably because the goddess is female. Though these sacrificing animals can be sympathised as \\u201cpoor animals\\u201d yet the females are lucky.\\n\\nThe Tantric worshipers are fond of this deity and they are found here as it is their most favoured place. It is their firm belief that they will achieve mastery over the Yantric vidya by meditating in this temple.\\n\\nAmbubachi Mela is a major festival for Tantric worshippers hence there will be thousands of tantric devotees in that annual festival. The Manasha Puja is another annual celebration where majority of non-Tantric devotees gather in thousands. In Navaratri festival days Durga Puja is celebrated every year in the autumn. This is a five-day festival when thousands of devotees from all over India flock around the temple for the holy darshan of the Goddess Kamakhya.\\n\\nThe Name 'Kamakhya\\u2019 has a mythological back ground. Lord Kamadeva, the love god, had lost his masculine power on account of a curse. In this place he meditated and pleased the goddess and acquired k his power and got rid from the curse. As a mark of his gaining potency the deity was installed and worshipped by him as such she came to be called as 'Kamakhya' Devi. The other story is that Shiva and Sati had their romantic encounters in this place. The word 'kama' in Sanskrit stands for love or lust and that is also a cause of action for the name \\u2018Kamakhya. In Hindi \\u2018Kama\\u2019 means love \\u2018kya\\u2019 means \\u2018what\\u2019 a question mark?\\n\\nOne other miracle (rather said to be a divine miracle) of the mother Goddess is that She bleeds during Ashada (June-July), which is attributed to be the menstruation. The blood joins the river Brahmaputra as a result the river turns red in the area of Kamakhya. Her temple is kept closed for three days. You may call it a story or myth. According to some, the priests pour vermilion into the waters to make it appear a symbolic menstruation. I had been to a Bhagavathi temple in Kerala where such a miracle is attributed to Goddess Bhagavathi.\\n\\nLast but another important aspect of this shrine is the tree with hundreds of bells of different sizes. It is believed that by tying a bell to this tree with a sincere prayer seeking any boon from the Goddess it will be fulfilled. Bells are available there itself. When you go there tie a bell to this holy tree with a prayer. Who known by the time you return home your request might get sanctioned. May Mother Goddess bless us all.\\n\\nGuwahati is the capital city of the State of Assam. It is well connected with buses from all parts of Assam as well as from other neighbouring States. It is connected with Railways from all important cities in India. There is an International airport. There are number of hotels restaurants to provide lodging and food at varying cost and range.

A must for every Hindu\",\"Kamakhya Temple is undoubtedly the greatest attraction in Guwahati. One of the holiest shrines of Maa Sati, the Adya Shakti. After the death of Sati in the Daksha Yajna, Lord Shiva became angry and after punishing Daksha with what he desreved, began to tour the world taking the body of Maa Sati on his shoulder. To calm him down, Lord Vishnu had to cut the holy body into pieces with his Shudarshana Chakra and the body parts got scattered over a large part. 52 such parts fell in different places and each one later became Shakti Peetha. One of the parts, her genital, fell here in Kamrup Kamakhya. People from all over India come here as pilgrims. Many foreigners also come to visit the place.\\n\\nIts a nice temple atop Nilachal Hill. Apart from the main temple, there are 10 other temples of the Dasa Maha Vidyas, Maa Sati's 10 different incarnations.

It is heard that the God doesnot let you go without fulfiling your prayer.\",\"This temple is one of the oldest fifty one Shakti Peethas in India. This is where the womb and vagina of Sati fell when Lord Vishnu cut Her body into 108 pieces which fell in different places and became sacred Shakti Peethams. Lord Kamadeva worshipped Kamakhya Devi (also called Tripura Sundaridevi) to regain his virility. According to another legend Brahma was challenged by Shakti when he became arrogant and cursed him that He could thereafter create only with the blessings of Her Yoni, the sole creative principle. After much penance Brahma brought a bright light of heaven and placed it within the Yoni circle which was created by Goddess and placed it at Kamarupa\\u2019s Kamkhya\\u2019s temple. She is regarded as an incarnation of Kali in KalikaPurana composed in 10th century.\\n\\nSituated at a height of 561 feet above on Nilachal hill, this temple attracts many devotees from all over the country. On this hill only, one can see separate shrines for Tantric goddesses called DasaMahavidyas like Kali, Tara, Buvaneshwari,Bhagalamukhi, Bhairavi,Chinnamasta,Dhumavathi and Shodashi. Inside the main shrine, Tripura Sundari,Matangi and Kamala reside.\\nOne can travel by taxi or auto to reach the uphill. From there one has to climb a few steps to reach the main temple. On the way one can see a row of shops selling pooja material. The narrow lanes remind us the lanes in Benares leading o KashiVishwanth temple. One has to descend a flight of steps as the main temple is at a lower level. A temple pond (SauvagyaKund) is seen. A few small shrines are seen there. Near the main shrine one can see two huge lion idols with many carved figures of gods and goddesses on the outer walls of the temple tower. The temple tower is in the shape of a hemispherical dome with seven oval spires topped by three golden pitchers or Kumbhas. The inner temple is below ground level. One has to wait patiently for hours to get darshan here. Otherwise one can buy special darshan ticket for 501/- and get darshan within one hour. The pandas here demand hefty amount and so one should be cautious while negotiating with them. But there is no hurried pushing of crowds in the queues. The devotees are permitted to go in a line in an orderly way. Near the darshan queue, there is a separate place where animals and birds are sacrificed. Generally goats, hens, ducks and pigeons are offered as sacrifice in morning hours. As we went in the afternoon we did not see any bloodshed or dead animals there.\\n\\nThe temple has three chambers with a narrow corridor. In the outer chamber one can see the metal idols of the Goddess and Lord Shiva draped in silk clothes and decorated with flowers. The devotees offer pooja material here and touch the holy water near these idols and sprinkle it on their heads. In the middle chamber there is a cave which leads to a natural underground spring that comes from a fissure in the rock. This is the Shakti peetham of Kamakhya where the goddess is seen as a 10-inch deep depression shaped in the form of yoni or female genital organ. Devotees sprinkle water form this deep fissure over their heads. On the walls in the cave one can see the sculptures of Ganesha, gods and goddesses. The idols are covered with silk clothes and smeared with heaps of kumkum and one cannot see the idols clearly. Not only here but in other temples also, the idols are not cleanly maintained. The shrines are very small and way is dark and so one cannot see the idols properly. No boards are kept to give information about those idols also.\\n\\nAccording to legends this temple was first built by Narakasura and later by the kings of Mleccha dynasty in 8thand 9th century. Later it was destroyed by Hussein Sha, a Muslim ruler. The ruins of the temple were discovered by Viswasingha, the founder of the Koch dynasty who revived the temple as a site of worship. His son, Nara Narayan (1540-1587) reconstructed this temple in 1565. In 1658 the kingdom of Kamarupa came under the rule of Ahom kings who further improved the temple. During the rule of SibaSingha, son of RudraSingha,the mangamentof the temple was handed over to toKrishnaram Bhattacharya, a Shaktamahant of Bengal. Even now the descendants of his family and his disciples (ParbatiyaGosains) act as priests. This temple was an ancient site of sacrificial place of Khasi people. That is why even now devotees sacrifice animals as offering to Goddess. Vajrayana, a type of mystic and tantric Buddhist sect, flourished in Kamakhya in 16th century.One can see the figures of Nara Narayan and Viswasingha on the temple walls. Just near the exit one can see a shrine for the Goddess Annapurna.This temple is regarded as the oldest place for Sakti cult and tantric worship. Even now one can see tantric monks around the temple premises. In and around this temple there are shrines for deities like for Kali, Tata, Bhuvaneswari, Durga, kedareswara, and gadadhara. As the sunset is very early at 5.00 p.m. we could not see all other temples. In these small shrines no priest is found and there is no light to see the idols in the shrine. People say that Bhuvaneswari temple is on the highest point of the hill at a height of 690 feet and one can have a panoramic view of the natural surroundings. Nearly two hundred people connected with temple duties reside on this hill. The temple opens at 8.00 a.m and closes at 5.00 p.m. So one should better come here early to have darshan.\\n\\nAt the donation counter also proper administration is lacking. For donors some Prasad and photos are to be given. During the month of June the Kamakhya temple is closed for three days when the waters of the river Brahmaputra turn red. People believe that the goddess menstruates during these days and so none is allowed to see Her. The cloth covering the idol also turns red. On this occasion lakhs of devotees attend the function called Ambhbachi Mela. Tantriks do special poojas during this time. During Nava Rathri five-day festival is observed.Many devotees buy \\u201cKamakhyaSindoor\\u201d made from a special type of rock and regard it as a blessing from the Goddess.

The place where animal sacrifices were done before had a live goat lying on the steps nearby, symbolically anointed with the red vermillion. The seven smaller individual temples of the Mahavidhya forms  of  goddess and three forms including Tripura Sundari inside the main temple were inspiring. We could not view the inner sanctum which is below ground level, as it was late in the evening.

It was a partially researched trip due to the lack of exhaustive reviews covering practical aspects associated with the trip. I reached Guwahati a day earlier and stayed in Narangi. It is displaced from kamakhya by a decent distance and it took me about half an hour to reach. The traffic at Guwahati is fairly orderly by Assam standards but has a potential to intimidate you by the abundance of fly-overs and lack of sign-boards. What follows is my trip report covering all issues and practical problems faced by a devotee on the. 1.  WHEN TO VISIT.  The guidance provided by most websites/ blogs containing info about Kamakhya Temple is largely accurate. One should avoid periods of festivities, unless the trip is intended that way, to stay clear of unprecedented crowds and avoidable hassles. The place attracts huge number of devotees (lacs at times) during the annual ' Ambubachi Mela'- the days of the Great Goddess's annual mensturation- and becomes an epitome of a casual devotee's nightmare. The festival is celebrated in the month of June and is best avoided. Other occasions like the annual \\\"Manasha Puja', \\\"Durga Puja' and the Navratri may be included in one's caution-list on discretion. Periods of rain, as such, won\\u2019t pose much problem if you are equipped with a personal umbrella.  2.  TEMPLE TIMING.  The Kamakhya Devi official website states the following timings: Morning 8 to 1330. Afternoon 1430 to 1730 (Arti Time). The Temple `receives offerings from devotees in the form of 'animal sacrifice' everyday. The timings, as told by a local shopkeeper, are from morning to 1300 hrs. If you cannot stand the sight (which is in full view and indeed gruesome), avoid a morning darshan.  3.  WHERE TO STAY.  I stayed with the Army at Narangi so do not have much to say on this topic. Decent material is available on popular travel-booking websites to be consumed. The advice I'd like to offer is that if your trip is exclusively for the Darshan, stay close to the temple. Whatever little Guwahati has to offer (restaurants, attractions, shopping centres etc.) is close by then.4.  WHAT TO CARRY.  The climate is humid most of the year (except winter months). If visiting outside the cold months carry sufficient face towels and wear light and absorbent cotton clothes. The temple has an AC duct within the inner sanctum which is notorious for its lack of effectiveness and is often unserviceable. With the crowds it tends to be quiet hot and sweaty.   5.  HOW TO REACH.  The route to the Temple is serviced by shared Tata Sumo taxies and autos at expected rates. Private taxies are easily available from several taxi stands of from operators. 6.  THE ROUTE.  I shall talk about the climb only. It is about 4 km one way. The view of the city and the Brahmaputra is excellent and must be given its due time in your programme. Stop on the way up if you can, for the return may see you tired and unwilling. 7.  THE PARKING.  Unless you fall in the much celebrated VIP category (definition of which is as ambiguous as the art of serving the VIPs), head uphill from the barrier towards the right for the general parking lot. The VIP parking, nearer to the shrine by just a few metres, is overcrowded and requires superior parking skills.8.  THE 'PRASAD'.  The purchase of prasad is most convenient if done from shops located close to the shrine. This allows you to continue wearing your footwear for longer (the prasad shops would safe-keep them for free). I found the shops to be typical and the shopkeepers non-insistent. There is no facility for offering coconuts by traditional breaking within the temple, so we decided not to buy one. The sweets (peda, burfi etc.), as brought out by an unusually honest shopkeeper, are made mainly from sugar and powdered milk. We refrained from buying them. 9.  CARRIAGE OF MOBILES ETC.   The temple complex has signs showing restriction on the use of mobiles and cameras, but carrying of all possible accessories is allowed as there is practically no security check. Avoid items as dictated by common sense. 10.  THE TICKETS.  One of the factors which have barred Hinduism from having a healthy proliferation and have restricted it to fewer followers compared to other major religions is the way the practise of the faith has been manipulated by its (authorized??) handlers. 'Rule of the cash', as seen at other major Hindu shrines is seen here as well, though in a more systematic manner. The devotees are provided with the option of a quicker and more comfortable darshan by paying Rs 101 and 501 per person. Once in possession of the tickets, you are allotted a VIP gate for entry which takes you ahead of the swarming crowds (and makes you a VIP of sorts in their eyes!). If you subscribe to the practise of 'preferential treatment' based on money, and do not see this as a form of corruption, you can obtain the tickets with reasonable ease. When in possession of the tickets, ensure that you walk in your designated queue (there are few sign boards to educate you) or else you'll run the risk of losing the advantage you have gained over the common man. There is a provision of 'passes' for defence personnel (YES, the Temple Trust respects our soldiers and feels that they may be given a head start for the darshan in recognition of their sacrifices; NO, the passes are not entirely free. They cost Rs 10) at the same counters selling other tickets. These passes are not available during festivities. 11.  THE PANDAS (PRIESTS OF CONVENIENCE).  For all those who do not know what the topic means, a Panda (pronounced 'punda')is a priest of sorts who facilitates your communion with God by acting as a guide to various rituals and performs rites with you and on your behalf. So much for the original reason for the institution of the panda system. What the Pandas have degenerated to now is for everyone to see. The Pandas are anything but facilitators at most shrines these days. With no regard for humanity and absent basic-decency, they will arm-twist an unsuspecting devotee into coughing up money and gifts, all in the name of God. To me they are outstanding mood-spoilers. So much said, the Panda menace is, luckily, non-existent at the Kamakhya Temple. The association of Pandas has dished out pretty relentless rules and the members appeared eager to follow. The bottomline:  at Kamakhya Temple a Panda troubles you only if you want him to.12.  THE DARSHAN.  There is no idol of the Goddess in the Temple. What you are expected to do is touch the water and spend a moment of prayer when inside the inner sanctum. You can choose to take back the items of prasad with you (including the flowers and the cloth) or leave them at the service of the Devi. I felt the Darshan, barring the difficulty caused by the unserviceable AC, was quiet hassle free. 13.  TIME REQUIRED.  It took me close to two hrs from parking to parking. As per the locals, it was one of the leaner days. On days of full crowd, expect the time required to only rise. 14.  SUITABILITY FOR PEOPLE WITH LIMITATIONS ON WALKING/STANDING.  There is no facility or space to sit and rest once you are in the queue. The queue path is unsuitable for a wheelchair. People with difficulty in walking or standing should choose only the days of the leanest crowds. The weekdays have lesser crowd compared to weekends and holidays. 15.  FOOD.  Unlike many other shrines where a post-Darshan meal is readily available, the Kamakhya Temple appeared to be a little conservative. There are three shops near the VIP parking lot selling the usual snacks (South-Indian, punjabi, chaat etc.). There was apparently no supply of milk forcing the unscrupulous use of powdered milk for everything from sweets to tea.\",\"It is compulsory to visit Kamakhya Temple while in Guwahati.

Visited the temple during the peak Dushera season; however the crowd was very well controlled.  You can buy a special ticket for visit in case you are short of time.  There are many halls for the visitors as they pass through the queue and the devotees move with patience.  They are served water from outside by volunteers.  The Guards are strict and control the crowd well to make the Darshan convenient despite the rush.  This is perhaps one of the few temples where you can remain in the Sanctum Sanctorum for about an hour as you move and you can have a memorable darshan.\",\"Just come and rise in love with the temple. If u r blessed then you may have to wait for a longer period  for a DARSHAN as you ca stay in her campus for a longer duration...\",\"We 3 went for darshan today.reached at around 10 am,purchased Pooja material and rs 500 tickets and sat in waiting room.After about 30 mts were made to enter line separate from general line.Both lines can accommodate 80 people and are opened one at at a time and takes around 30-40mts to finish for each.General line thus if too long can be real time consuming.We had great darshan of MA with assistance of pundit although garbh Graha was fully covered with flowers. Mobile, purse etc are also allowed.\",\"The Kamakhya Temple is supposedly built on the premises where Sati's yoni fell when her body parts were scattered across India. Hence it is a major tantric center.\\nThe complex houses many temples and also a place where ritual animal slaughter is carried out.\\n\\nEntry to the temple complex was free, but you only get an outside view, the line may be much shorter.\\n\\nTo get into the inside garba graha (sanctum sanctorum) there was a special ticket for 501/- INR, but even though the line was very long, it took 2-3 hours to get inside, the experience was humid, hot, sticky, chaotic.\\n\\nThere were hundreds of Pandits and everyone jostle with each for one-upmanship. If you are thinking to do some special pooja, you can bargain with pandits.\\n\\nIf you aren't a devotee, I'd advise you to just take a look from the outer gates and enjoy the complex itself.\\n\\nPreferably visit in the morning, so the ground isn't too hot (as you have to enter barefoot)\",\"I went with two other friends for darshan and stood in queue at 9:30am and reached at 11:30am to the main temple . To add to my disappointment we dint even spend 2min and it was utterly dark inside the temple, sort of gory. There were sheep and goats everywhere in the temple arena and I asked my friend what the deal with all the slaughtering. Then he told me the entire story of how it came to be a shakti peetha and how pious it is. I guess the walk to the temple is well worth it but visiting the main temple sanctum needs some courage.\",\"the temple is situated atop the nilachal hill and is one of the shaktipeeth . once you visit this temple and see the carvings and deities carefully you would realise the power and the deep tantrism that the temple pioneered. a must visit in guwahati for any one who travels to this part of the country.. one can make a quick darshan with VIP passes available at five hundred bucks. but be careful of the Pandaas.. they make quick money out of the tourists..\",\"So here we started our journey to Kamakhya Temple by Ola around 9.30.Dnt make this mistake again.Plz get yourself ready by6.30/7am.We had to wait up in a queue till 6pm to get Darshan .It was hectic also it was vry particular in the systems.Also special tickets are available for Rs 501 bt we couldnt abl to collect it as they are out f special tickets then.It was our mistake.Water was being served by sevayats.There are stalls for tea n snacks ovr ter.bathrooms are also clean ten other places.The priests are vry calm and sober tey dnt annoy u.I loved the environment also.\",\"Need minimum 2 hours for the visit. I started around 6 am , thinking that temple opens at 5:30 am. However, it does open but not for devotees. At early morning even , there was big queue. One can buy ticket for inr 501, which would give quick access.  For paid ticket , people start queuing up at 6 am. Would suggest to start early morning if you want to finish darshan in couple of hours. Beware of sants and sadhus who would ask for dakhsina and donation on the name of Puja.\",\"It was crowded and were told that it would take an entire day to complete the darshan. There was an alternate darshan which we were taken by a couple of guys who took 200 per person. Felt more like a con because all were allowed to take that queue anyways and which did not take more than 20 minutes for darshan of an alternate idol placed. The actual sanctum sanctorum darshan is not possible this way. Dont get conned by these folks posing in pujari dress. If you have time take the normal darshan or the Rs 500 darshan.\\nThe surroundings are also not very clean with all the goats roaming around. If you are weak hearted then avoid looking at the animal sacrifice place which is next to the temple.\",\"This powerful Shakti Peeth temple is located on top of a small hill. We were told that it would take at least 2-3 hours for darshan. Surprisingly since we went closer to closing time of temple we had to wait for just 5 minutes or so for our darshan! I understand there are special priced tickets for Rs 500 wherein you can have darshan a bit fast.\\n\\nI may not go back to this place again as the attitude of priests there repulsed me. I have never seen such open demand for money anywhere else in India. Please ensure you don't repeat any mantra chanted by them or indulge them in any conversation as that would ultimately lead to dakshina demand!\",\"The aura is unmistakable. But expect crowds and long waiting periods. The sanctum sanctorum is pitch dark, lit only by oil lamps. There are old stone steps and you need to feel your way.\\nBut the energy is powerful.

The place is being maintained very clean and tidy and the architecture is too being well maintained. Hardly managed to get darshan and the darshan was so peaceful, There is a special darshan for physically handicapped people too but that ticket is also issued at some hour of the day. so the timing should be well known before you go if you want to use any such services.\",\"One of the holiest place for Hindus,thousands of devotees visit daily and during auspicious days in Lacs but totally mismanaged,even after getting a (so called) VIP ticket have to wait for hours,it's ok to wait as lots of devotees visit to have darshan but should have better crowd control mechanism.\",\"good temple but fully commercialized was late by 15 mins of official ticket counter closing time of 5 pm but one pujari got the tickets for 500 extra dakshina  a to tal commercial establishment i felt though its one of the shakthi peetha.but a must visit place for guwahati.\",\"Very nice place to visit but must make sure that you have the best guide with you to guide through the temple premises as there are a lot of things to see with a mythological story associated with it.

Pls note for special line  ticket is available only at 6 30 to 7 am in morning and 2 pm in noon. We missed this so could only do darshan from outside with the help of pundit who usually charges 200 - 300 for this. General line is quite long.\",\"The temple is mostly crowded. You can do darshan of idol quickly but there is long queue of 5-6 hours to enter garbhgriha to touch holy water. There are VIP tickets but that also gets sold fast and still has a queue of 2 hours. We did idol darshan in 30 min of queue. The waiting in queue was bit stressful for my daughters as we have never seen temple where the animals are sacrificed. There were small goats and pigeons with tilak who were brought in and would be sacrificed later. That was bit in nerving. The darshan was divine although.

One had to stand in a narrow passage ( with iron grills on both sides ) which is just enough for a person to stand. My worry is that if a person is in the queue there are people ahead and behind him in hundreds. There are lot of elderly people. If someone feels ill how can he be brought out. There are no openings in the grills and during my visit I did not see any temple authorities to monitor the movement of this huge crowd. Since the waiting time for Darshan can take several hours, there should be provision for toilet facilities. Funds , I am sure is not the criteria. Here there should take the procedures from Tirupati .\",\"Kamakhya temple is on a hill which usually takes 30 min to reach without any hairpin bends across the way. Early morning or late evening rides to the hill will mesmerize you considering the serene mist in midst of deciduous forests. Numerous yogis frequent this place in search of salvation from ancient to even now. You can feel something once you enter the sanctum of course with devotion\",\"I visited Kamakhya temple on Sashti during Navratri in October which was the day from which it becomes very crowded and there is a long queue to enter the garbgriha which starts forming from 5:00 am in the morning. Even the VIP ticket holders need to wait hours to enter the complex so we decided to do Mukh Darshan only. We kept our shoes at a stall that was very close to the temple and also took offerings which were of very good quality from the same shop. Then once we entered we took the services of a pandit inside the complex who helped us in understanding where and how to do the puja as well as offered our items to the deity on the garbgriha on our behalf. There were lots of diyas lit and coconuts being broken at designated places along with cattle available for bali. There are pigeons as well available whom people bought and then freed from cages.\\nThe temple premises were very beautifully decorated for Navratri and the temple is unique. Along with that it\\u2019s location on a hill also makes the queue look invisible but the locals will tell you how long it is. As this is the only main attraction in Guwahati one must visit but decide on type of darshan as per your preference.\",\"Check opening timing before you visit. We reached in the afternoon and the temple was closed. Darshan done from outside the main sanctum. Some Pandits will offer you Darshan for a fee even after closing time.\",\"The temple complex was much cleaner and organized than many of the other hindu temples. We could easily buy the Rs 500 tickets and got to move ahead in line and could get darshan without much wait. The priest was very nice and helped us as we were new to the place. We obtained blessings from ma and consider ourselves lucky.\",\"Visited temple after a long gap.

Garbhalay is underground with no artificial lighting.. Need to have darshan under big oil lamp..you cannot see a idol here.. instead there is well kind of thing were holy water oozes and can be served as Prasad. Sathi Devi body part was believed to be fallen at this sacred place and is one of the 18 Shaktipeethas incarnated by Jagadguru Adi Shakaracharya.. you can see Shankaracharya statue on the way to temple pond.

The temple is secure with security personnel around and the ticket can be purchased from the counter itself, the counter closes at 4pm daily.\",\"Take enough time in hand as darshan may take time or if you can afford go for vip entry for a out of line darshan\",\"The shrine is well maintained, has a locker room,easy shoe deposit, crowds throng this temple, timings are morning 8:30am to 1:30pm then from 3 to 5pm, they have most details on site. The general que is very long so start very early by 530 am then you can have the darshan's in 2 hours, else there is an option of VIP darshan which costs Rs500, but they close it down at will depending on the crowds.this normally takes 1\\n-2 hours or more depending on the rush. The public transport system here is virtually non ex6, Uber/Ola will drop you but you have to be really lucky to get one back to take you downhill.the auto rickshaws Wallas are a moody lot, so can't be relied upon as there moods swing is based on where you wanna go, some shared Maruti van taxis can be available, they can be hired as full taxi also, but be prepared to shell out almost double of what it would cost you on an Ola or Uber.\",\"one of the sidh peeth....... must visit for all hindu.......their is always  a long Que for darshan so its better to opt for VIP darshan\",\"you must visit the temple, but you must be aware of timings for special darsan, which take less time. General queue takes much time!\",\"The place is amazingly decorated and peaceful but you need to be careful of the time you reach the temple  for your Darshan. If you plan to visit the temple on specially on Navami an desire to go to another places the same day by even completing the darshan nicely then you might get into a problem. It will obviously take you upto 12-15 hours for your darshan in general queue (but not so long if you go with a special ticket with a fee for 501/- per head). So please mind this situation also before planning the trips further from Kamakhya. If you get there at 3 or 4 am in the morning then you can probably complete your darshan before noon.\",\"One of shakti piths, it is one of the oldest too. There are two options for the darshan. One is normal queue, which can take anywhere between 2-4 hours. Other is the VIP darshan where you pay 501 for the pass. However, even with VIP pass please consider that the time taken will be atleast 1.5 to 2 hours.\",\"We were taken to see this temple by our guide and driver. There was an extremely long queue to go inside of at least two hours, possibly more. As we were visiting from the uk we were happy just to walk around the outside and soak up the atmosphere.\\n\\nThere are some spectacular carvings over six hundred years old.\\n\\nThe route to the temple is lined with stalls selling incense, flowers, scarves etc and is bustling with people. A good spot to feel the culture of India.\",\"I went their with my collegues in Jan earlier this year on a cold winter morning when it seemed diffiult to even stand bare footed. But yup, it was an experience not to be missed and I truly felt connected with the energy present out there. The only downside was that we had to take services of a professional brahmin to take us through else its quite a nightmare to manage through everything in a limited time. Though people might crib about the fees, but its nothing when you compare with other famous temples of India. Also, view from the top is spectacular!!\",\"It was Sunday when visited. there was a great rush for the Darshan. however some pandits can arrange the Darshan on payment. No good arrangement for shoe changing.\",\"I heard about this shaktipith and accidentely visited due to flight cancellation. It takes around 6 hours for the darshan of mata. But when i come out from the main temple, after darshan, that was amazing super power blessing/feeling. It is the temple of old age, where part of mata sati fallen, one of the shaktipith. You can visit from morning to evening. For darshan of main gruh, you need passion as it takes more than 4 hours atleast. Dont visit after 4 pm if want to do darshan. You can do mukh darshan without queue. Temple having various antique sculpture of godesses, and having holy effect. There are also cases of bali I have seen. This is amazing place having aura of mataji and you really feel satisfied, worth visiting and taking blessing.\",\"It is divine place with divine energy. Cleanness and decent behaviours of Pujaris are plus point. Extreme crowd is negative.Be ready to spare 5-6 hours for Darshan. It would be wise to go to temple in the evening to escape from the rush.\",\"This temple is one of the Shakti Peethas, and situated on the top of Ninanchal Hill in Guwahati city. There is no image of Skakti here but within a corner of the cave in the temple there is sculptured image of the yoni of the goddess.

The general queues are long and can take 3-4 hours. There is special queue for a charge (Donation) of Rs 501, which can get you darshan in 30-40 mins.\\nAvoid the pundits and keep moving without eye contact with them.

If possible, choose the VIP one and get early Darshan.\\nVery serene place and the management of Darshan line is very professional. They provide complementary water and tea in between.\",\"Read a lot in literature (bengali persons may remember Kalkuta).If you are a devotee,visiting the temple once in a lifetime is your passion,it won't let you down.Crowded and long,long queue inside an iron protected pathway is not a deterrent.Reach the goddess at last-- fine. In an older,historic part,adequately dark to arouse mystery and myth,you get the original---water trickling from stones underneath and pushed by the strong priests to avoid wastage of time.Sculptures surrounding the main temple are ordinary.Clay figures are large and smeared with vermilion.\\nDevi, I was in search for you.\",\"The ancient shrine of Kamakhya is located on Nilanchal Hill in the outskirts of Guwahati.

However , no e- booking available and everthing will have to be done by physically going there.\",\"Well renowned temple at hill top but always crowdy. However if you want only Darswan then can do it within less time. For touching the idols you need to wait in que for 3/4 hours.\",\"While the place is beautifully located on the nilanchal mountain, there is an abnormal delay and queue for darshan.\\nSpecial queue at Rs500 which is limited.\",\"It is not an architectural marvel like many other temples of South and Central India . But it has an aura and a positive vibration hardly to match any where else. That the temple follows the Tantric sect ideas may dissuade certain puritans but believe me it has a great charm of its own. The cave or the Gupha where the private parts of Devi Parvati is supposed to have fallen doesn\\u2019t have any idol. The holy water there represents the Goddess and the Darshan in the general queue ight take as long as 3 to 4 hours on a normal day. The 501 rupees VIP tickets are issued only till the three special waiting halls fill up. It starts around 6.30 am and gets over within an hour on special days and might be available for another hour or two on lean days. However one can have Darshan of the Goddess idol in the shrine right above the Gupha within an hour and it is free. But take the help of a Pandit so that you get good Darshan and get to know the history of the place. He will get you the Tirtha (holy water) from the cave too. The Dakshina you give will help him financially and your soul will get \\u2018Aatma Santosh \\u2018. Enjoy a stroll around the temple which is kept very clean and do peep into the various shops around to get a feel of the place. Eat \\u2018Amara\\u2019 fruit ( appears to be a distant cousin of Aam) and cucumber with salt and mirchi. Soak in the atmosphere of great belief of the visitors there. You will return happily satisfied.\",\"Great history and powerful temple .

This is a Shakti Peeth and is thronged by large number of devotees daily. We had visited around 7.30 am on a Saturday morning and had to stand in general queue for 3 hrs to get darshan. We could have opted for 500 rupees special darshan but we had time in our hand. While waiting in queue, devotees can sit at places and the queue was very well maintained. The holy water related to Goddess Sati is located in the main sanctum which is located below ground level of the main temple and one has to climb down steep dimly lit steps to reach there. Outside the temple at a designated location one can light diyas and incense sticks. Many devotees were sacrificing innocent goats & pigeons for their own selfish gain in life which made me feel sad.\",\"We went for Darshan in the Month of Nov-2017 in the early hours.We reached at around 0600 am and waited in the queue , the door opens up at 0700 hrs .It took us around 06 hrs in the queue.Their is a special queue if some one wants quick darshan for R/s 501.The management of crowd is very well.\",\"This temple is dedicated to the mother goddess Kamakhya. It is strongly suggested that you get the Rs. 500/- tickets for the darshan, the other queue was pretty long and would cut into hours into your travel time,\",\"No doubt very hectic to enter the main temple and it took us 7 hrs to  complete the darshan and come out.but once you enter all worries are over and you feel that you are in mothers lap.inside the temple during waiting in the beginning you can get tea and biscuits etc which is sold by vendors and of good quality. After that when you enter the  gallery then you won't get anything to eat.try to go as early as possible like 4 am onwards Then it will take less time fir darshan. The vip line will bypass only the starting waiting crowd so it's of no use.some priests will ask you for darshan for 500 Rs but they will take you only to the grills of main Moorti mandap and not inside it.if you have time then these shortcuts are useless.in the end the queue is doubled in a small gallery and I felt suffocated.they are making it air conditioned but really a crowded place. In the temple be prepared to be fooled by the priests asking for money.don't pay them and donate directly to temple.when you are in the main temple then it's great feeling as if we are in mothers lap.it's a nice place and one day is required here.ola and uber service is very good here.\",\"Well Kamakhya Temple is one of the major Shakti Peethas. It is based on a hill top and easily accessible by cabs and local buses.\\nTo begin with you have to spare an entire day if you wish to take the darshan of the peeth. Reach there in morning to take the darshan through general queue. It takes 4-5 hours if you go by general queue. There is VIP line which costs 500rs but still takes 2 hours of standing in the queue. The temple closes for darshan at 1pm and opens back at 2.30 pm so plan to complete darshan before 1pm. Kindly note that the VIP passes are issued only till 11am and then again from 2.30pm. So if you reach between 11am to 2.30pm you have to either wait or take the third option of taking darshan through a Pandit. It costs around 700rs per head but you get direct darshan inside the temple and takes only half hour. If you are very short of time take this option. We took the third option as we reached late. They also enchant some mantras and proper darshan can be taken.\\nHere many people offer goats to the goddess so you can see the be-heading of the goats in Katalkhana. Hence not for the weak hearted. It is a sad scene to watch the poor goats.\\nOutside temple you can purchase fresh rudraksha which they take out from the fruit of it. Costs only 10rs per rudraksha. Do purchase them as they are real rudrashas.\",\"The temple premises are clean considering the number of visitors. Take care if you are claustrophobic as inner sanctum is sort of underground cave, has no electric lighting and queue can be tight. But people are generally polite and no pushing or shoving was experienced. Visit early for smooth passage. The temple experience is unlike any other. Feels elemental, unadulterated and close to mother goddess.  No shiny marble or granite, no gaudy decorations, no electric lights in main chamber. Facilities around temple could do with some improvement but I think that has a lot to do with economics.\",\"A well maintained temple and is a place you should not miss to visit.This is one of the SAKSHI PEEDAMS  and the deity is considered to be very powerful and is a very ancient temple.  If you want to worship the deity closely you have to buy rs.500 ticket which is time restricted.  So you have to plan your visit so that you do not miss.  You can also plan to go in early morning hours before  7 am  so that you can have dharshan in one to two hours.  If you go afterwards you mm ay have to wait for five hours to have dharshan.  Proper planning will help you to have early dharshan.  You are permitted to carry your mobiles and cameras with you.  But if the bags are bigger they do not allow and you may have to keep the bags with a private  vendor close to the entrance.  But your bag is kept openly and you have to be I've them.  Avoid carrying big bags unless there is no other alternative when you visit the temple.\",\"We started early in the morning..Took Rs 501 ticket.. Waited in question for 40 minutes..

After wandering the premises for few minutes lined up at the general queue at 2.30 . Initially the queue moved very slowly but gradually in picked up pace after 4.30. Our Darshan was completed by 6 PM . Inner sanctum is very narrow and can feel a bit claustrophobic.  Experience is divine though.\",\"The temple is situated on the top of a hill and gives an awesome view of the city. Devotees can actually feel the energy in the temple campus. One can do Tatkal darshan by paying INR 501 otherwise the queue is long and takes 2-3 hours for darshan\",\"This temple is one of the Shakti peet nd is very powerful. The general queue will take a long time whereas the special 500 queue moved much quicker. The moorthy was in the form of water nd is situated deep inside. It was such a divine experience\",\"We visited at 3 pm on VIP pass. Had less rush and was able to do darshan comparatively sooner than expected. Very neat and well maintained temple. Lots of Pujaris keep standing and asking you for accompanying you for puja, personally we didn't take any help of pujaris, felt it more of a business for them. Touch here, touch there, put money here and there... So it's your choice. The darshan was spell bounding, but it's very dark inside and last passage is quite narrow. So old people should take care.\",\"Even though its a place of worship. i stopped going to it a long time back because i don't feel like paying bribe to enter the temple.people have made this their business\",\"Awesome place to be with friends and family. You have to be in a que for 2-3 hours for darshan or you can go via VIP pass though it is all worth it\",\"Management is impeccable. VIP passes are not always available.  It took us 3 hours in general queue for darshan but temple staff managed it so well that you won't know that you have spent so much time in queue. Firstly there is no standing queue up until u enter the shrine. Devotees need to sit on chairs and move onto next chair. The entire area is covered.There are fans for you and people are there to hand you glass of water at every point. Don't get disheartened that you need to wait min 2- 3hrs as the Management and Darshan will make you feel blessed\",\"Please plan for morning darshan with 2 hours expected darshan entry with special tickets booking for Rs 500.The rush is round the year and blessings for the devotees.\",\"Happen to visit the temple on my visit to Guwahati ...

Should visit during your stay at Guwahati.\",\"This is a very important Devi temple in this part of the country.  If you have the time do visit this temple.  See that you have atleast 3-4 hours while going into this temple, since the crowds are huge.  I spent around a couple of hours in the general queue in the early morning.  The queue starts forming from early in the morning.  Since I was alone, the pandits/tauts did not trouble me at all.  The Darshan was very fulfilling.  There are a number of eating places around the temple.  You can take a bus to the foot hills of the temple and take a share taxi to the temple.  Not very expensive to reach the temple.\",\"One of the best Shaktipithas in the country. Got a beautiful Darshan after waiting 4 hours in a long queue. The Prasad served by the Temple management is simply superb.\",\"Heard and read a lot about the Kamakhya, one must try to visit Kamakhya.\\nI would suggest to opt for the line by purchasing the tickets of Rs 501.00 as I made the mistake of standing at the general Que, it took five hours to offer prayer.\\nPurohit - Pradeep Sharma - 9864273657\",\"lovely location,on hillside and very good fervour but sacrifice of animals(nothing against the practice) in open view of waiting devotees can be avoided. Darshan sells! Are less priviledged not worthy of equal treatment? Is discrimination on basis of money constitutional? Is apathy towards common people waiting in line for darshan for 5-6 hours where as moneyed go straight inside sanctum sanctorum guided by priests, culture of our religion and society? Surely not!\",\"I rate this place totally from the religious perspective. One needs a lot of patience to have darshan here. Even with VIP pass it may take 4 hours. It is best to go around 6am - it would take much less time. Also avoid weekends.\\nNo one returns empty handed after the darshan of Maa Kamakhya. Ask and you shall be given - but go with faith\",\"Visited this place in May 2017. Nice temple on top of hill. It's one of the shaktipeeth as per Hindu mythology. But it takes quite a lot of time to have darshan. There is no idol in this temple. In garbhgriha there is a area which has the holy water filled which needs to be touched for goddesses blessing. It is lit only with earthen lamps and thus quite dark. We reached there by 1:30 pm on a Friday. Though the temple is closed from 1 pm to 2:30 pm, people line up in queue to wait for darshan. When we went the general darshan queue was quite big and we thought of taking VIP pass. The VIP pass cost 501\\u20b9 per person. We checked with one of priest in temple premises if we should take the pass. He informed that VIP pass counter will open at 3 pm and you should join the general queue as it will be cleared first. So we joined the queue and we came out after darshan in 2 hrs. The temple manages the general queue and VIP queue very well and there is no chaos. You get a very good darshan.\",\"Amazing holy ambience, this was my second visit to the temple after 12 years,\\n\\nYou can wear shoes till the climb up to the last gate, keep the shoes at a store - purchase Prasad from there, buy a VIP ticket to have a shorter wait in the queue or decide to spend time in a longer serpentine but well managed queue\\n\\nThe temple closes in the evening at around 5:30, so I landed there around 3:45, I had my Darshan in 1.5 hours time\\n\\nSome priests can ask you to give in more money like every other Indian temple but usually they don't push or force you\\n\\nThe security is well managed and the temple premises are clean\\n\\nIf you have a local priest accompanying you, you could request him for some holy water and a small piece of the Blessed red cloth and he would hand it over to you\\n\\nIt's advisable not to the visit in the morning if you are averse to hearing the belching cries of the sacrificial animals or blood, afternoons that way are easier to walk through the temple\\n\\nAs they say, The Mother Calls - so if you are visiting her and get a chance know it's time, enjoy the Darshan!\",\"Can't give God a review hence giving 5 on 5. But be aware that animal offerings are offered to the goddess here including a big head of a bull at her feet which is offered every morning to her. Just felt that should be changed as no Hinduism practice dictates the followers to harm any other soul.\\n\\nAlso, even if you buy the special ticket (Rs. 501) you'll still have to wait for an hour or so.

Although the temple itself is old, maybe 17th c., there's no doubt the spring has been a source of mother goddess worship from very ancient times.\",\"One of the most powerful Shaktipeeth in India, this is a must visit temple in Guwahati. The waiting queues can get quite long on days (as long as 5-6 hrs), so getting a 500/- ticket is a lot more convenient. There are lots of animal and bird sacrifices everyday, so those who are faint hearted must be prepared for this.

The street and temple premise is well paved.\\n\\nPREMISE: approached by the wide street flanked by Pooja shops on both sides. Street climbs a little but is not tiring at all. Well managed organization catering to all individual\\u2019s faith of pooja, donations and other temple activities. A queue takes the devotees to the inner sanctums and back. Those not wanting to take queue can visit the upper part of temple freely. An amphitheatrical steps outside offers place to seat for while in peace. Overall quite cleaner place. Afternoon hours has a little less rush. Inner sanctum remain closed for couple of hours in afternoon.\\n\\nGENERAL: Respecting the faith and dignity of the place, chose to ware appropriate attire. Is Well-guarded and secured temple so avoid keeping any additional gadgets and accessories with self. Security personnel just doing their job so good to co-operate. Photography Tripod was not allowed on our day of visit. Cameras were allowed after checking. Did not come across any decent restaurant around. Good to keep dry food supplements.\",\"Know for historic connection with Ma Shakti. Excellent build temple With great stone structure. It has great energy to it.\\n\\nReally have to take away panada. Not get in touch with them. If you want general dershan reach early around 6 am for line. Alternative you can reach for special line cost around Rs 500 per person.\",\"It was a great feeling when you are in the premises of this temple, there are 2 options for darshan, be in queue or take a pass of 500 Rs for priority entrance.\",\"Well, I am not much of a temple person and usually avoid going to a crowded place. On my parents' insistence, we were there in the morning around 8:30 and each of us got queued up. A lot of people. Sweaty people. Some excited and some tired people. A variety of people from all over India, mumbling and at times muttering in a variety of language. Wet floor. Smoke and the fragrance of the incense sticks in the air and sight of young, innocent goats ready to be sacrificed and offered to the deity; clamouring of the temple bells evoked a concoction of positive and negative thoughts, at times questioning why do we do what we do here and how different is this world from the my world which mostly confines to digital screens and office cubicles, and does it all matter? Reaching Maa and finally get her darshan is a journey of such random thoughts and observations. As the darshan to the deity neared, the mind chose to believe in all the legends and started to flip a plethora of unfulfilled desires and wishes so that it can present the one which is most wanted and desired to Maa so that it can be realized. A maddening rush to get a glimpse of her and feel her presence, lead us to climb down some stairs in an almost dark, dimly lit and damp chamber where I felt a feeling of accomplishment to get Her darshan.\\n\\nUnlike the beginning, where I was all questioning, I left the temple pemises with a positive feeling and little hungry,so, gorged myself on a Dosa in one of the eateries just outside the temple.\\n\\nVisit this temple for faith :)\",\"First of all, read a lot about the temple and its importance. There is practically no way you can learn about it when you there. Plan out your timings. The temple opens at 8 am and closes at 1pm, opens again at 3pm till 8pm (? not sure).\\n\\nThere are three darshan queues, Army, Rs.101 (special) and general (free). The Army and Rs. 101 queues have timings (again read about it) and tickets are not available all the time. I went when the counter was closed so I had to join the general queue. I joined at about 1130 am but till about 1pm the queue practically did not progress.\\n\\nThen it progressed but the gates were shut at 1.20pm and I was told it wont open till 3.00 pm. My flight was in a couple of hours and so I had to leave the queue. Unfortunate I could not see the deity.\\n\\nApart from that, this is a fantastic place for photography. Most people are dressed in red and it makes for great pictures. The place has a lot of animals roaming about (for sacrifice, I presume) and its quite a colourful sight.\\n\\nA lot of people roam about in red dress and it is easy to mistake them for genuine pujaris, but it is best to ask them to show their credentials before appointing them.\\n\\nThe temple is right up a hill and you can easily spend the whole day here. If you are taking an auto, negoatiate the waiting charges before hand. It will easily take you 3-4 hours. If the auto driver is not ready to negotiate the waiting charge, tell him there are plenty of transport options to go back and just pay him the one way charge. You can save some money that way.\",\"We visited here two times yet. There are three types of queue. One free (takes around 5/6 hours for darshan), one with 100 Rs ticket, (may be 1/2 hour less than the free one for darshan) and one with Rs. 500 (take around half and hour for darshan). Being a devotional , we sit on free queue and give our time at temple. Queue moves for around 5 mins and stops for half an hour or so and it continues accordingly till you enter inner temple.\\nAfter entering inner temple , my wife and daughter were surprised to see me crying for nothing. I do not know myself but tears are just continuously dropping from my eye and all of a sudden I became very emotional. We all are surprised by the power of \\\"Kamakhya Mata\\\" and did darshan. Darshan is a kind of like you go inside a dark chamber and priest offer you to touch the holy water and give you blessing.\\nFirst time in my life, I am so inclined to believe power of god and the things which were pending were all solved as we return home. We haven't asked anything from god, however \\\"Ma Kamakhya\\\" is so kind enough to bless us.\\nJay Ma Kamakhya. Whenever we have time we will definitely visit the temple.\\n\\nThe only negative things we saw is priest with red cloths are on sacrificing baby \\\"he-goat\\\" as a offerings and blood around the hall. Try to close your eye when you are on queue to avoid seeing this sacrifice.\",\"One of the most crowded temples in india. Buy a rupees 501 pass to have an not so fast \\\"express ticket\\\". Dare not try the general free line. Once inside the temple don't give out cash to all pandits, they will force you to pay.

No point taking this 500 rs ticket.\\nU will have to end up standing in the que for 3-4 hours at least. Take out time and come and not go for paid entry.

We were fortunate to visit during the Dussehra. We took the Rs. 500 pass and could get the darshan in about 2 hours; we came to know that general darshan would take around 6-7 hours ! Read the history about this temple, the sacrifices made during, etc. from wikipedia - this will help you understand and connect better.\",\"Beauty is the word, a place you would love to visit and feel how the Belief works. The belief in the Kamakhya Devi is undoubtful and pays! Take at least 4-5 hours off your time to visit and come-back form the pilgrimage. Very neat and clean. Be careful of the local pandits as they would try to take away all the cash you have.\",\"We visited this hotel by 07am.

The sanctum santorium is at a low level of a cave/crypt.. it gives you an historic and powerful feel  of history and devotion along with mythology..

The other is the normal line which might take some time on normal days but on festivals the waiting time might get as nasty as 4-5 hours.

It was a really wonderful experience. Usually heavy crowd will be there foe darshan.

If Naraka would be able to build a staircase from the bottom of the Nilachal hill to the temple within one night, then she would surely marry him.\\n\\nNaraka took it as a challenge and tried all with his might to do this marathon task. He was almost about to accomplish the job when the Devi, panic-stricken as she was to see this, played a trick on him. She strangled a cock and made it crow untimely to give the impression of dawn to Naraka. Duped by the trick even Naraka thought that it was a futile job and left it half way through. Later he chased the cock and killed it in a place which is now known as Kukurakata, situated in the district of Darrang. The incomplete staircase is known as Mekhelauja path.\",\"The temple is great in architecture but the queues are very long most of the year around. The general line can take up to evening to clear. There is a VIP line but even that gets sold quickly for 500 bucks. So if you want to complete darshans at a reasonably good time get in queue early, maybe as early as four in morning. There is a third line called mukhdarshan line which is also good as it passes in front of the deity. You can see the deity and pray but not offer anything to it in puja. I did the last line as I had a flight to catch and it was great. This third line was quickly moving and noone was pushing people around.\",\"Words can not describe the visit.

It's a big temple. It's same like other temple's much but you need a lot of patience to visit the place as it may take upto few hours in the queue. Moreover get into temple with your pockets full of 100's currency notes. Every pandit sitting over there on the sub temple's clearly demands of a 100 Rs note openly & you can't refuse it...

To get into the inside garba graha (sanctum sanctorum) there is a special ticket for 501/- INR. But even though the line is much shorter, the experience is humid, hot, sticky, chaotic. Pandits inside, jostle with each for one-upmanship.\\n\\nIn India, men don't normally have physical contact with women unknown/unrelated to them and this is very strictly upheld in temples. But here, I was routinely held at the shoulders and wrists by pandits supposedly trying to enforce discipline in the queue. It wasn't groping at all. But it made me very uncomfortable because I do not expect to be physically touched in this way inside a temple.\\n\\nIf you aren't a devotee, I'd advise you to just take a look from the outer gates and enjoy thye complex itself.\\n\\nPreferably visit in the morning, so the ground isn't too hot (as you have to enter barefoot)\",\"1st dont visit on Tuesdays or on holidays. We visited on 26 Dec, a Tuesday and in holiday seasons. We reached late, about 9:30 am. The queue was more than 2 thousands then. The Rs 500vip counter was already closed.

I was travelling with my mom hence was worried if I had to stand for hours in the queue. Having spent thousands on flight tickets and hotel it didn\\u2019t bother me to pay for special entry. Took Ola from my hotel - cab stops like 10 mins away from the temple. It\\u2019s a short walk lined by shops. As soon as we entered there was a pandit who told us he could arrange for Darshan. I was very clear I needed the special entry tickets and would pay only after Darshan. He came back in 2 mins with the tickets. Within 10 mins I was inside the main shrine. Saw the pandit who sold me the tickets there -he asked for like 50 rs Dakshina and did a small puja. Yes there are animal sacrifice with blood stains in full display - I m a meat eater so it didn\\u2019t bother me but I understand why some people are repelled or upset. Then the pandit led us to the main sanctum. Steps are super narrow. People will push - be careful. There is no idol - you will be asked to touch the water flowing. It\\u2019s really tough as it\\u2019s very dark and suffocating. You need to come back thru the same stairs - now it makes sense why the general queue would take that long! Be prepared to give Dakshina there as well. I don\\u2019t think any of that money goes towards temple maintenance. Within 45 mins we were out. I would visit again. Pay attention to the old statues inside the shrine if you like a bit of history! It\\u2019s safe for women ( me and my mom visited). Once outside you can take pics - it\\u2019s not very clean around.\",\"Its located on a hill and is almost always very crowded. Is one of the places where all tourists visit.

Else we heard that it can even take 3 to 4 hrs for a darshan.\",\"Don't carry your toddlers along as the sanctum is very dark and slippery .There is no artificial lighting inside .One has to stand in a queue for hours together and therefore it is proposed to visit this place early in the morning so that darshan can be completed within 2 hrs\",\"It was memorable trip however the waiting time was more but manageable. Temple was neat and clean and surrounding was also good\",\"Located on a small hill Kamakhya Temple is the main attraction of Guwahati.It is a well maintained temple.Generally very crowded but the day I visited the crowd was thin and I could get to complete darshan in one hour on rs 501 ticket.The place has a mythological importance and every Hindu wants go here at least once in his lifetime.\",\"The temple is huge and people stand in the queue for 3-4 hrs for darshan.

Although the VIP pass was not available still had a peaceful darshan.\",\"The temple is located on a hill overlooking the river Brahmaputra. The last 3 km approach to the temple has lots of twist & turns. Limited parking is available at the shrine. For the general queue it takes about 3 to 5 hour for the Darshan and it depends on the day of visit ( avoid Saturdays, Sundays & Holidays). Another option is to buy VIP tickets the cost of which is Rs.501/- per person. However VIP passes are issued only till 11am and then again from 2.30pm & it takes approximately two hours if you manage the VIP passes. There is a separate option for Defense Personnel, wherein direct entry is provided at Gate number 3. But the time to obtain these passes are 7 am to 8 am & 3  to 3.30 pm.  Further the temple closes from 1 pm to 2.30 pm. So preferably plan to visit the temple in the morning when the temple has just opened or opening in the afternoon i.e 2.30 pm. The atmosphere near the temple gives you a reverberating feeling of spiritual awakening & the visit gives an immense sense of accomplishment. The temple is very well maintained & beautiful. It is said that the worshipped goddess of the temple is very powerful & therefore it's a must religious visit. The temple has lot of shops which provide Pooja materials, light snacks & other basic basic amenities like public toilets etc. Purses, leather belts & cameras are allowed however photography is not allowed inside the temple.

I saw some people with pigeons and sheep. I hope they were not being sacrificed in the temple. The temple represents fertility aspect of Mother and is frequented by thousands of pilgrims.

Also, visit 7 other temples nearby, which are also of powerful tantrik goddesses namely Bagalamukhi ma, Bhuvaneshwari ma, bhairavi ma, dhumavati ma, chhinnamasta ma, Tara ma and Kali ma.

Must visit!!\",\"This is one of the most famous temples of india.On 28th April,2013 I and my wife planned to visit this Temple.As It was sunday there was very huge crowd at the temple.We came to the site at about 10 Am.The Punda told us to buy a ticket for Rs 5oo each if want to have darshan with an hour.For 4 hours wait we have buy a ticket of Rs. 100 Each.Free darshan one should have to wait for more than 8 to10 hours for which que start at 7Am.We bought ticket for  100 each and our turn came at 2.30Pm.Since we had our sharda for the god as we enjoyed a lot in singing bhajans.I recommend the tourist should avoid to visit this temple on Sunday and other holidays as there would be big crowd on these days.I disliked bali of goats and birds which is beeing carried out here.Rather people should contrbute the cost of goats and birds to Temple Authority for arranging langars and  for other wefare activity  at the temple.\",\"You must set aside atleast 2-3 hours, if you propose to join general queue for darshan at Kamakhya temple. Or you can pay Rs. 101 (bribe the almighty?!)and take special darshan. One more option is for 'Mukh Darshan' i.e. darshan from a distance, which is a quick affair. Enter from gate no. 2 for Mukh Darshan.\",\"No words. A must visit place to seek blessings and spiritual awareness. You can avail vip pass for rs 500 per adult for early darshan. It would take around an hour. For general darshan make sure you reach early as it takes around 4-5 hrs. Friendly environment around the temple. Lots of fooding options also available.\",\"Reached here by a local bus from kamakhya junction railway station, crowd was heavy ,i got the darshan in 2.5 hrs ,deity is excellent, don't miss it\",\"Very famous temple. beautiful and very crowdy. well known in India for parvati goddess.\\nvisited in the morning and took around 4 hr's in darshan through VIP lane.\",\"Second visit to Khamakya devi Shakti Peeth. Heavy rush of devotees always. Special darshanam tickets are available. Takes 2-3 hours for Darshan. It is on the hill.\",\"We visited Kamakhya Temple in January 2017. Once you start walking towards the temple you will feel that divine aura surrounding you. Some helpful tips\\n1. You can buy VIP darshan tickets after paying 501 rs\\n2. it not a very high climb or trek to reach temple so even people with less fitness can visit the temple easily.\",\"It was their new year(Bihu) when we visited the temple, so it was over crowded. You need to start early if you want to get a darshan without waiting in long queues for hours or you need to take a VIP pass which takes less time and you will get darshan more quickly.\",\"We went for a darshan very early (around 6:30 AM) but the temple was not yet open. There were long queues both for free darshan and Rs 500 special darshan even by that time. We ended up praying from outside. But it was a good feeling to visit this famous and powerful temple on Dussera day..\",\"Good experience in a short visit. People are helpful there, pandit's guides you well. Bags are not allowed inside temple, but you can carry camera. To know the history of this temple, talk one of the friendly priest.\",\"Situated on top of a hill, the temple  is peaceful, clean and well maintained. It will take at least half a day at the temple (on ordinary days, not sure how it is during festivals) as there are long queues for the darshan.\",\"This is a top attraction in Guwahati and heavily crowded on almost all days.If you want to have free dharshan, plan a whole day for that, go early morning, stand in the queue for hours together and leave after dharshan in the afternoon. Even for the special dharshan, costing Rs.501, they limit the number and by the time, we reached there at 10-30 AM, tickets were sold out. We had to go back again before 1:30 PM to stand in the line for these tickets. There is no orderly system there and the counters opened only at 3 PM. The staff manning this are extremely rude and in connivance with the temple staff, even offered immediate dharshan for a bribe.There is no online orderly system for paid dharshan , as practised in Tirupati.I felt that a whole day was wasted, there are no good places around to eat and better pack some snacks or drinks before embarking on this visit.\\nEven though animal sacrifices banned in the country, this is one temple, where it still goes on.\",\"I have visited Kamakhya temple very good temple I have waiting more than 5 hour for darshan everything good\",\"The wait is too long. The ticket  prices very high. We got cheated by a young punda named Biswa who took rs 6400  fir 3 people for Darshan . He didn\\u2019t  tell us his fees till we got to the temple. It took 3 and half hours for darshan . Thank god they now have some light in the cave . Of course inside the small cave people were pushing each other.\",\"We made two visits to the temple on the 29th and 30th May 2023.\\nOn the First visit We were there by 8.00 AM as per the timings mentioned on the temple website and other related sources. A rather unexpected situation awaited us. The queue lines were too long for free Darshan and the special Darshan was closed by 7.00 AM (Their daily limit for morning Darshan is 200 tickets. Once sold or by 7.00 AM the counter is closed for the morning. We were directed for a Mukha Darshan which took 10 mins. We get to see the diety from outside.\\nOn day two as suggested by the priests We got there by 5.00 AM to find about 20 to 30 people already in line for special Darshan. The free Darshan was a long queue already. The counter opened at 6.00 AM and we had a good Darshan in about half an hour.\\nHope this information helps.\",\"There's always a horde if people in and around the temple area waiting to visit the holy shrine. Even though it takes some time to get inside and once you are inside everything gets done with so quickly even then you can feel calmness within you once you are done with.\",\"Good look from out side , Mukha Darshan is very easy . Always having  crowd -  surroundings are good .  Always seems busy for pilgrimages .\",\"Its an old and notable temple of the east, and extremely well regarded. Hence extremely crowded, at any time of the day. Since we were in the vicinity, we decided to pay a visit. You can comfortably take a walk around the complex. There is a gate through which you can see the Shivji/Parvati moorti and can do your darshan. In my opinion, this should suffice.\\n\\nHowever, We were pumped up about the 2 \\\"kunds\\\" (one each dedicated to goddess Laxmi and Parvati) and were keen to see it and therefore needed to get into the queue. Basically you can either go in the free queue (budget 4-5 hours), 101/-, 251 and 501/- queues with varying lengths of time in the queue.\\nWe decided to take the 501/- tickets for the shorter queue. Even with the 501/- queue we took > 90 minutes for the darshan.\\n\\nThe kunds are the inner sanctum of the temple and are accessible only by the queue. you are expected to dip your hands in the kund and touch your forehead. To dip your hand, you have to kneel down and bend into the kund (~ 2 feet). Its extremely crowded at this spot and the queues tend to fail at this point. the ground is uneven and I would not recommend it for the elderly / people with disabilities or those with young kids.\\nDidnt think it was a big deal and on hindsight, could have easily missed it with no regrets..\\n\\nGood to know:\\n1. 501/- tickets apply only for persons> 10 years. Kids under 10 go free.\\n2. No bags are allowed inside the complex. I had to leave my handbag with the shoes and carry my wallet in my hand.\\n3. Cameras are ok. You can click in the complex but not the mandir itself.\\n4. Pandas are nice (unlike in Banaras or Puri). They accepted a no graciously.\\n5. we did NOT see any sacrificial animals anywhere. we did see caged pigeons that you can set free. We did not, because we're quite convinced the pigeons are recycled - caged, freed, caged, freed and did not want to support the \\\"economy\\\" in this way.\\n6. There are several shops that ask you to leave your shoes with them for 75p; but will do so only if you buy the pooja thali from them. We didnt use them, instead used the official temple shoe-stand paying a princely sum of Rs 3 per pair. Happily :-)\",\"An extremely neat, clean, well organized and managed Temple. Early morning darshan is strongly recommended\",\"Kamakhya Mandir is the main attraction of the city of Guwahati, the Gateway of all other North Eastern states of India. It takes about half an hour to reach the temple from main city centre by cabs or auto-rickshaws. Be prepared to keep 6-8 hours reserved for que before reaching the Sanctum Santorum and touching the holy water. VIP line facility on payment of \\u20b9500 can cut short the waiting time to 2-3 hours. The Pandas are very gentle and least demanding. We try to visit at least once in a couple of years. Animal sacrifice is an inevitable part of this Shakti Peeth.\",\"This Temple gives U a divine experience even when it follows some of the unconventional cults which may not go down very well with some of the 'modern liberals'. It took us 4 hours to get the Darshan of the Holy Goddess even after getting into the so called VIP line after paying Rs 500 per head. A must visit place if U are physically fit and have 4-6 hours to spend along with the cost of VIP ticket.\",\"Seems like the divinity and spirituality has given away to mere business. If u pay for the highest ticket of Rs 501 per person, you will get darshan within a hour. We, family of 6, bought Rs 101 tickets and couldn't finish the darshan even after standing in the queue for more than 3 hours due to lack of time\",\"Had the opportunity to have the Darshan at Ma Kamakhya Devi temple. There is a VIP line for Rs 501 however the waiting is more than 1.5 hours in the queue, with no provision to go for washroom. It could be made better like Vaishnodevi where the line keeps moving. The management can improve. The Darshan were fantastic and felt Blessed. A must visit for all, located on hill top.\",\"he Temple is ancient. If you want to avoid crowds go to gate no 2 and have darshan from a Door. If one have time then it could be good to Q and have darshan\",\"In my tour to Guwahati in May 2015, I visited the temple. It is highly a spiritual place. Always crowded temple, you have to wait for long hours (5-6 hours or more) to have a darshan (free darshan queue). For Rs.101/- ticket, it takes more than 2-3 hours depending on the crowd. I took Rs.501/- ticket and finished darshan within one hour. Every person who have faith can feel the spiritual power of the temple. There are several temples nearby to visit.  It is best to take a hired car from the city to go to the temple over Nilachal Hill. Otherwise one can take shared vehicles (mostly Maruti Omni) from the foot of the hills. From top of the hill, you can also take shared vehicle.\",\"It was business trip and I was running out of time of third day and final leg of trip. I had one and half hours before I must continue to airport. When I reached temple it was so peaceful.. Lovely place on top of hill. It is shaktipeeth and religious, sacred place for Hindus. Temple had disciplined, quiet queue and no one was pushing for darshan. It's always good to have 2-3 hours in hand for darshan. Good for me that line was short and I could get blessings in time. I was waiting for years to get here and blessed to had darshan. A must visit place for those who believe in.\",\"Arrived at 8AM. Info counter informed that VIP are cancelled for morning session.VIP tickets will be issued at 2 PM onwards. As I could not wait had a dharsan of Shakti maa in the ground level praharam in 10 minutes.The waiting time for sarvas dharsan was long and expected to take over 4 hours.

Their first priority was that you offer the prayers and Puja peacefully.\",\"The Kamakhya Temple is wonderfully located- atop the hill (Nilachal). Heard a lot about the Kamakhya temple. One has to come , see and feel the truth . The vendors outside the temple and the purohits  are extremely well behaved and there never is a craving for your money. Even if it time consuming, it is worth offering a prayer after standing in a big que. The charges are also nominal, they accept whatever is offered.\",\"Visited on weekend and was terrified with the normal queue. Though I am against paying extra for a special visit, I had no option with two kids, and so got the 500 Rs special darshan, Even through this, it took us almost 30 min to offer our prayers to the deity. A polite NO to the pandas helps. I was told the entry is open only till 5 pm. The localites informed that a visit on weekday between 4-5 pm is the best to avoid crowd.\",\"We had gone to this temple in the month of Dec 2016. It was a neat easily accessible place, not troubled by pandas, felt at peace.\",\"Overall this place is nice. One thing they should learn from Vaishno Devi is to organise and manage crowd both in queue and also when inside the main temple complex. Its dark inside the garbh grih and the space also is narrow. The flow of people is not managed at all, we have the pandas also pushing in. Proper management of crowd is required else it may lead to some major accidents some day\",\"PANDAS are very helpful, great scenic beauty all around the TEMPLE, easy approach to the temple from GUWAHATI CITY,\\none of the oldest hindu temple in INDIA\",\"This is a well known temple which is revered and visited by Hindus across the globe. During our recent visit to this site, we were very sad that due to no information available from the management, we returned empty handed without a darshan even after standing in queue for over 4 hours. We could see that the pandas were having a field day, but we were left in the dark about the tickets, counters, approx time required. Hope this is addressed quickly, so that devotees are properly guided and their effort to visit this location does not go in vain!\",\"When you reach temple directly goes to the administration counter and ask for the ticket. Dont go to any pandas or Poojaris.  They will mislead you with all nonsense and upset and spoil you r day.\",\"This is a temple dedicated to Ma Kaali.

Taxi driver introduced one Panda (Temple Man). First he sold a Puja Thali (necessary things for worship) @ Rs. 700. Then he asked us whether we will take VIP line or Normal Line. If we take VIP line it will take 1.5 hours to complete our worship and if we take normal line it will take 3.5-4.5 hours to complete the worship.

There is no online booking anymore and the ticket needs to be bought at the counter which opened at 6:30 a.m. for us.

Pandas are very helpful and one cannot forget the hospitality of the people here\",\"One of the most important shaktipeeth, Kamakhya temple attracts the highest number of devotees  from all around the country. It is situated on Neelachal hills in Guwahati and can be easily reached by any mode of transport (Car / bikes /auto /bus).  The road is good and the ride uphill is smooth.  Good parking facilities are available. The Pandas (priests) are not the obnoxious lot normally seen at so many other temples and often are good guides for the tourists.The main concern is the lack of cleanliness.  The whole way up to the temple from the parking lot is full of small shops, cattles, goatsetc. Even inside the temple premises the area is littered with pigeon / goat droppings. There is an altar for sacrificing animals / pigeon and drops of blood can be seen here and there. The temple authorities will do well to improve upon this aspect.\",\"Lovely temple. Felt the blessings of the mother. Definately a must go if one visits Guwahati. None of the pandas asked for any money as dakshina. We gave whatever we wanted and wish that others also can enjoy the grace of the mother\",\"I visited this world famous temple on 25.03.18 for darshan. I reached there at 5.00 p.m. I was being told that darshan que is closed. It was last Navratra on that day. I was being told to come on next day early morning for darshan. I reached at 6.00 a.m and stood in que with my family. By 12.30 p.m. I found there was no chance of any darshan because que was not at all moving. I came out of que to bring some eatables for my kids. Then I came to know the real cause of delay in darshan. There was hardly any system followed for Darshan of general que. Temple Pandas were taking the people from back gate for darshan (may be after getting some extra amount). I guess there were hardly 2 to 3 thousand people in the que and if systematically darshana were performed, hardly it would have taken 2 to 3 hours to clear the line. But it was not done deliberately to create the panic among devotees so that they could be forced to pay some amount for darshana.\\nThe Kamakhya temple is a most powerful shakti peeth of India. I wonder how Govt. & local admin can leave the devotees coming from all the parts of world on the mercy of Pandas inside the temple and got exploited by them. Why not State Govt. undertake the administration of this temple so that there may be transparent system of darshan be followed like other temples.\",\"You will need a bus/auto ride rise to the temple else hire a private cab.The temple is worth a visit specially for its historical value.You will need to visit before 10 am if you want to have a Vip ticket which will take you down the cave in no time.Else stand in the normal queue which might take 3-4 hours.Not miche hassle from the pandas,this is a must see if you are in Guwahati..\",\"Great temple. Just avoid the pandas or pujaris. You will find them all across the temple. If you are in hurry, a VIP darshan slip can be bought to avoid huge cue.\",\"The temple is on a hill, just on the outskirts of Guwahati. The view around is scenic. The local pandits or the 'panda's will gather around you for performing a pooja. Have a quick darshan and go around the temple to avoid getting stuck with the crowd.

The floor was stained red with sindoor or blood, whatever it was, it looked scary than sacred. Fat pigeons, wandered on temple grounds, unable to fly, counting their last days.

On most days, the temple is crowded with devotees thronging for a darshan of the Goddess. Even the VIP queue (Rs 500) is often crowded and if you reach there early (about 6.45 am), you may still have to wait for 3-4 hours on a normal day to enter the sanctum sanctorum. The priests (pandas) will help you offer the pooja for a certain price and are well behaved. Some of the older pandas will give you a historical perspective, which I will strongly recommend.\",\"I went on a 5 day trip of Assam & Meghalaya from 19th April to 23rd April with my wife. Since I read from the reviews in Trip Advisor that there is lot of crowd in this temple on week ends and also on Tuesday & Friday, we purposely started from Bengaluru on Thursday morning flight on 19th Thursday, reached our hotel (Nandan in G.S.Road, Pulton Bazar) at around 1.30pm as the flight was delayed by almost 2 hours, and once checked in, took a taxi arranged by hotel, and went straight to the temple, as the first thing to do in our 5 days' trip of North East.\\n\\nLuckily for us, there was no rush at all on that day. Once we entered the temple premises, a Panda (poojary) approached offering assistance. We asked him his fee, he said whatever we pay he will accept as \\\"dakshina\\\". We agreed for Rs 300 for both of us put together. He started to guide us immediately, took us to the Rs 501 special darshan counter where there was no queue at all. After purchasing the tickets, he directed us to a small queue of 10-15 persons in the special darshan queue. We could complete the darshan with his help/guidance within just 20 minutes from the time we stood in the queue.\\n\\nAfter darshan, we paid his dakshina and spent 20-30 minutes in the temple premises on our own, taking some photos, and pouring some oil into the \\\"diyas\\\" kept inside the premises.\\n\\nFor those pilgrims who want to avail guide from the above mentioned poojary, I am giving his mobile number 7002803138. It is not necessary that we should go through Rs 501 tickets only. He can also guide pilgrims who opt for free darshan.

We used the taxi for almost 5 hours.\",\"In this temple I was converted into Brahmin.

Kamakhya temple is very clean and is free from Panda culture which we generally see in other temples where Pandas basically harass the devotees. Infact one can go inside without a Panda and perform puja. There are infact arrangements for VIP tickets worth Rs. 500/- or Rs. 100/- ticket where one gets relief from the long Que. Since the Temple is on the Hill Top, one can visit Bhubaneswari Temple and from where one can get to see the scenic beauty of Guwahati city across the Mighty Brahmaputra river.\",\"the pandas here create great nuisance. only busy in money making. the feel and piousness of this place is fast declining\",\"Liked:neat and clean.

If climbing is not possible they have people who will carry you on a chair (with handle for two guys to lift) for a fee. However inside the temple there are few steps too.\\nYou need to remove shoes and can deposit shoes for INR 5 per pair.\\nPandas ( people who assist you in offering worship/guide) are available but they don't harass you unlike few other temples. You may or may not hire one. Fees are up to negotiation.\\nThere are free queue and paid queues. If you pay INR 500 per person you have fastest access to temple.

So, people interested in mysticism will find the place appealing. The temple management committee has recently changed the rules for visitors and removed VIP quota, so anybody going there will have to get into long ques for Darshan (entry into the sanctum sanctorum). Overall, the temple premises is clean, and the Pandas (spiritual tour-guides/ priests) are less demanding than many other temples in India, educated and well mannered.

Just politely avoid them and go to the rear of the temple and enter the temple at no cost and go right inside to see and pray . One would be just 10 feet away but you get Darshana.

Its a MUST.\",\"We visited this must - see temple in Guwahati and we're definitely drawn by the unique concept of Sati's womb having fallen here and being worshipped for so many years. It is not something that one comes by in Hindu temples. We went in the afternoon and waited for the temple to reopen at 2 PM. The ticket window opened 35 mins late and we got the special entry ticket (500 rupees for one). But after that the darshan was very quick as there were no lines (this was a Tuesday). Inside, the temple is not very well maintained or organised. We saw big cockroaches right when the sanctum Santorum starts and dead ones too on our exit that got squished under the feet of devotees. I was quite taken aback and distracted at the sight of the big cockroaches. Inside the temple each and every panda insists on donation which also puts one off. However, regardless of all that, the temple still is worth a visit for its uniqueness.\\n\\nThe uniqueness is largely attributed to the fact that there is no large idol inside the sanctorum, which is worshipped. Instead the sanctorum is dark and has a small water hole. The idea is unique and connects one to the concept of worshipping the womb, I.e. Creator of life. I wish they had a museum or a proper information centre to help pilgrims and tourists better understand the ideological and architectural importance of the temple.

We had bought the VIP tickets and were able to go down to be able to get to see the devi (Goddess). Our Panda was quite helpful since he took my mother (she had severe arthritis problem) ahead even within  the VIP queue and got the worship done.

The temple is different from other Hindu places of worship as there is no specific idol that is worshipped here. Don't be dejected when you reach the end of the serpentine queue, only to find a fresh water spring with lots of flowers sprinkled on it and someone pushing you turn back and clear the place for the next devotee. Mother godess is present in an abstract form here. The belief of the hundreds of devotees that throng this place every day ascertains this fact over and over again.

This is situated at the top of a hill so one has to leave the vehicle quite a long way off. the climb is gradual so it is easy on the legs. One can choose to leave the slippers and bags at the shops selling the Puja items or in their vehicles. Cameras are allowed inside with no one restricting .\",\"The mistique Kamakahya Temple was always on my list to visit as it has been famed for it's Tantrik practices. We got a chance to visit this place during our trip to Arunachal Pradesh. The temple is situated on a hilltop at outskirt of the city, I liked the location. For Darshan, there are many queues and one can buy higher priced tickets to reduce waiting time. Remember it will reduce only as I found the pricey queue also to be long enough. However, you will be approached by the local priests (called as Panda) who can arrange quick darshan from a distance. They will be more than happy to help you if you want to offer more than your devotion only!!\",\"I like the temple from my child hood but 1st time i visited the temple in the year 2000. I have visited the temple more than 5 times since 2000. facility and clenliness are incressing day by day except the back side of pond. Becareful from Panda. Rest are nice.\",\"Well u can't give less rating to Ma Kamakhya , most of my wishes were fulfilled , however beware of thugs and pandas who try to loot u as they have got no other job to do. If u got time u can wait in no fee queue if not them buy short cut tickets, Goddess doesn't minds . The Place is poorly maintained but u will feel spiritually illuminated as if some high divine power is there.\",\"We had been thinking of visiting the temple for so many years but Ma was not calling.This time our desire got fulfilled.We purchased tickets for fast darshan and total time taken was around 1hr.The darshan was smooth and no panda coerced us. We,being strict vegetarians,were apprehensive about animal sacrifice but nothing of the sort was seen at that time and our visit went off nicely with Ma's blessings.\",\"This is one of the most important of the sakthi peet's\\n\\nThe temple is very old according to the scriptures, but seems to have been maintained reasonably well. Just the main core structure is littered around with pigeon droppings, and ofcourse we could see quite a few goats walking around\\n\\nThere are a whole lot of shops selling the puja items and flowers, you can choose to buy if you want, the shop keepers try to sell you stuff, but dont bother you too much like some other places.\\n\\nthere are two types of darshan's\\n1. The first one is when you stand in a queue to go inside the sanctum sanctorum and do the puja yourself (here there are two options, one if the free darshan and the other one is 500 per head)\\nUnfortunately when we went, both of them were crowded and it appeared we would have to spend atleast 2-3 hours for the darshan.... so we chose the next option\\n2. You can go to through the other entrance and walk inside to have a darshan of Maa kamakhya (very similar to what you do in most other temples especially in south india)... you can stand in that area to have a good darshan and move on..\\nshould you wish, you can buy puja items and then give it to a Panda who will perform the sankalp and take the items inside to do the puja on your behalf (again very similar to what you are used to in many south indian temples).. and you can pay the panda what you want..there is no fixed amount, some people give 100 some 1000.. it really depends on what you want to give to them...\\nWhat i liked about the pandas was that they ask you if you want to perform the puja and if you deny they dont bother you again and again...\\n\\nWord of caution, there is one particular block on the backside of the temple where they sacrifice the animals.... you are better of staying away if you dont want such acts to spoil your divine experience of the temple...just dont look around...\\n\\nPersonaly i wish they had a separate seggregated place away from the main temple to do such things without really affecting the more modest pilgrims visiting... but it is what it is...\",\"I left my hotel at 5.45 am and visited this temple.  There is a system of Rs. 501 entry slip for above 10 years person in the queue. Even that takes about two and a half hours. This slip office opens at around 7.15 am.  Pandas at the faciity are like pandas at any other religious place in India which is not owned by some shrine board etc.  They are greedy and they know how to make best utilization of their skills to make maximum money for your beliefs.  The temple is the most famous thing and a must visit place in Guwahati.\",\"We were a family of 3 adults, went early in the morning, bought Rs.500/- ticket, sat in an A/c hall / stood in the queue for about 3 hours and had a very good, most satisfying darshan.

Pandas of this temple are humble and do not heckle or pesture.\\nWhat is missing is a display or information on the route of the queue and \\\"Time to Darshan\\\".

Perhaps every 10th or 50th Devote can be given an RFID tag to scan and display the current \\\"Time to Darshan\\\" so others can benefit.\",\"Divinity at its best.

We reached temple at 6 15 AM by Auto. Paltan Bazar to Temple fare is Rs 250. After reaching base of the temple, we need to climb stairs. My mother has serious knee issues, but even she was able to climb with little support. There are many shops to buy puja material, they will allow to keep shoes for free. As advised by our Panda, we climbed full with Shoes and then just before entering temple, we remove the shoes in a shop and purchased Puja items. It is purely based on personal wish.\\nWe entered inside temple. My wife went to VIP Darshan Queue where our names are already registered, she paid Rs 501 per head and collected the tickets. Till them I was managing kids and all senior citizens.\\nNext we entered VIP waiting hall. It is big room where lots of people are seating, Waiting time is around 2 hours in that hall seating comfortably under fan.

Pls be careful here inside Garbhagriha there is no light, fully dark and stairs are uneven. My mother was not able to fold her knee and seat on ground to touch water, it will be very difficult to seat and get up so fast, hardly in one minute you will be pushed out of temple.\\n\\nAfter coming out there will be many Pujaris asking to touch different idols for blessing, but as you touch immediately they will demand money. So pls be careful.\\n\\nWe came out of Mandir, did Pradakshina and collected Prasad and Holy water from our Panda. We paid him Dakshina..\\nNow photo time.. took lots of Photos, also we paid professional photographer to take some photos, they delivered in 5 minutes and Quality was good.\\nWhile climbing down, we purchased some gift items for our relatives, prices are very high, need to bargain.\\nAfter coming down, there are many hotels offering Breakfast service, we finished breakfast and then catch returned auto for Hotel (Rs 250 to Paltan Bazar)\\n\\nNote- Uber is very costly in city, and 99% they will ask you to cancel saying they are in opposite side etc..

One panda near the entrance approached and advised us to buy some pooja material so that he could take us inside the temple through the back gate. He took us inside the temple through back gate and chanted some manthra and demanded Rs. 1000/  his service charge which we paid and left the place.

It is advisable to hire a car  or a driver. The temple is Over crowded as any other pilgrim spot.... The difference lies in crowd management. There are no accurate signage. You basically get lost if not accustomed to the scenario. Better, if you get hold of a panda/ pujari of the temple and mobilise him before plunging in to the long and never ending ques. There are bhog/ prasad for the devotees every day from the Temple Management within the premises. Enquire about it from the panda.\",\"An Excellent place to visit in Guwahati.

I did not see any panda coercing to hire them, unlike what I read in post by some one.  Just one point to note:  please be careful when you enter main sanctum, my father slipped and even I was about to.  Luckily managed.  Secondly, had also read in review some where that it is difficult for ppl with med problems.  Well that depends.

We went early in the morning and hence had not to face the crowd. Our friend at Guvahati made arrangements for pandas for offering puja and they led us in the temple without any hassle. With their help we could offer puja very nicely and felt very much blessed. In the temple we felt very much powerful feeling of inner peace. However, there were some pigeons and goats for sacrifice in the temple. It was no good and also the temple needs more cleanliness.\",\"Religious place to worship.

Even the special darshan with Rs.500 ticket will take long hours.  Added to this, the temple timings makes it worst. Therefore, please be prepared for long hours and plan accordingly.

Don't forget to visit each mandir of das mahavidyas. I couldn't find Shodashi mandir, and nobody could give me a proper answer about it. However Kumar I puja is the most important puja here.

The crowd management, the discipline and general ambience is superlative compared to a lot of other temples in India. Despite the crowd the noise level is low and there is no eve teasing, pushing or shouting. One can buy a vip ticket for 501 rupeees but this too will make you stand in a line for over one and half hours on a holiday. The security staff offer water to people waiting. The pandas do not demand money and are polite. Before entering the temple one is taken to a small pond  to wash ones feet and hands. Before entering the temple while is waiting to enter one can go the bali place where goats, buffalo and pigeons are offered in a ceremonial manner to the goddess. This is not for the faint hearted. Despite the sacrifice the place is clean and there is no unpleasant odour. People are allowed into the temple in batches. The best thing is that the interior of the temple has a great air conditioning system. This ensures that despite the crowds one does not feel so claustrophobic. The garbha  griha is at a lower level like a cave. This is where things get a little chaotic.One is supposed to touch the water,splay it over ones head and drink it. After darshan  the pujaries makes one light a diya and agarbatti near the exit. One then takes a circle of the mandir.\",\"One of the most revered temple in India.

The road to the temple is picturesque and clean. The temple area is quite clean and one can feel positive energy flowing the environment. Best part is one can directly get a Darshan if you don't have time by paying some extra money. It is advisable to get help by hiring any priest. It helps as they explain about the temple and can get your Puja done properly. Word of advise, the practice of sacrifice does happen at this temple, hence, you may think twice if you are travelling with kids.\",\"its an auto ride from the city, and really a holy place. i heard its spiritual and lively. but the only thing i hate is the queue one hs to stand and the Unnecessary charges that Pandas ask for after evry step. but overall , u would find solace .\",\"This is one of the high profile and famous Sakthi temples in India.

You pay them whatever you feel is appropriate (appreciate).\\nAir conditioning and good exhaust inside the main temple.\\nPlace to keep your shoes (FOC).\\nPlease pick the prasad from outside the temple.\\nFacility for people to sit.\\nThe temple is on a hillock. The beautiful scenic view.\\n\\nNegatives:\\nThe main sanctum has few stairs. These are carved out of stone and due to usage over the years have become uneven. One needs to be careful of tripping.\\nIf you are in the non VIP queue of devotees, God forbid when your turn will come because the VIP queue is allowed to go inside first.\\nStairs leading to the main temple, about a hundred.\\nDirty, unlike the temples in the south which are very clean.\\nAbsence of a decent place to eat near the temple.\\nIn appropriate and far off parking.\\n\\nHowever, any one coming to Guwahati must visit this temple.\",\"Bargain for everything from panda to trinkets.Safe place with lot of divinie vibration.>Keep lot of time for lot of small temples in and around.nice experience.Taxi from station Rs.200/-one way,\",\"TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE visiting the temple. we stood in queue at 6a.m and entered into main temple at 2p.m. after entering, PANDAS and PRIESTS are asking money as dakshina. if you are unable to give money ,they use slungs shamelessly .\",\"This temple is unique and the deity is considered powerful.\\nThere is a free line and a paid line (Rs.500 / head) to visit the temple. The tickets for the paid line are given only during certain times in the morning and the afternoon. The free line would take 2-5 hrs while the paid one would take about 1-2 hrs.\\nWhile the pandas (priests) do not hound you unlike Kalighat, you need to be careful inside the sanctum\",\"the visit & the Puja at the Kamakhya temple was very satisfying ...we had got a good Panda( the priests who help in performing Puja) and everything was hassle free...we had gone for a Rs. 500/- paid queue as we had old people with us ...so the wait was only for 10 min.. the Panda ( Mr. Sharma) was well versed with the history of the temple and the rituals of the Puja..and the price for his service?? anything that we wanted to give.. no haggling, no sledging, no bullying..we gave him 200 for 5 of us for almost 2 hours of service...\\nbut be careful of the priests inside the temple ...they ask for money at every turn...our Pandaji had warned us of the same in advance and saved us from the bullying.\",\"A very good old temple to visit.  There are some old unused staircase up to temple but not used by tourists.  Don't get prey to cheaters... One day you may just roam around to know the Panda through whom u would give or offer puja\",\"attracts a lot of tourists as well as pilgrims from all over India and outside, special and fast tours organized by temple authority at different priced tickets...no harassement fromm pandas is the best thing\",\"Ancient Temple... But no problem with the Pandas... Get ticket of rupees 500 for entry to the main ShaktiSthal... Which is near about 300 mtr down from temple\",\"Reaching the Temple: I was staying in hotel near Ganeshguri. It took more than an hour from OLA to reach, remember always book OLA/ UBER in Cash payment or else drivers will cancel your trip. The vibes are too powerful if you have belief in such powers. Temple is always crowded, pandas would be after your life to take you inside for darshan. Bargain with them before going inside or else they will cheat you, the temple turned into a market place filled with greed. Ultimately if you have faith in GOD, u will feel positive\",\"access to main temple was with ease. panda torture missing/minimal as compared to other temples in east. local buses fly between ulubari to kamakhya temple enterance, they charge Rs.10 per person. enterance to main temple another 10 bucks by shared taxi.\",\"Just away from Pandas. The temples overall management is good. You options of regular line or 500rs ticket. The 500rs ticket just helps you beat the line before it enters the temple. Every bit worth it. As we had gone on one of the less crowded days in the 500 rs line, we got a darshan in 45 minutes. The best part is that there is no discrimination in the darshan The darshan is same for all. From a particular point both regular and special line merges. Just a request to the authorities to keep Pandas out. Only salaried pandits at their points. No separate services to be rendered by the pandits. CCTV cameras to weed out corruption in the dakshinas.\",\"'Ma Kamakhya's blessings is sought after by one and all &no one returns empty handed from her abode.This is the place where one of the organs of the Devi fell. People across the country make it a point to visit the Devi's shrine for her blessings.The queue is generally large and it takes about an hour to reach the Devi (except during special puja days) . Pandas generally help the people in guiding them inside the mandir.I have visited so many times and every time the Panda helped me with the puja &darshan though I had to stand in a gueue. What ever I pay they accept it with a smile. I You just name your Panda and no one will bother you.The visit is a good experience for everyone.Some people come up to\\nget their wishes fulfilled while some come to get the blessing of the Goddess for any important work.This phenomenon is common everywhere in the world but the form may be different.Few things need a change no doubt but this will take time indeed.Many of us do not like animal sacrifice and have written about it strongly too.Slowly the mindset is also changing.Many people bring the animal and after puja let it go scott free.\\nYou may also visit the large Tortoise and call it by name,it will come up.Though the area is cleaned regularly still the pressure of devotees are so high that the maintenance need more manpower to sustain.When the belief is supreme we all have to overlook the shortcomings at times but may put in our suggestions for improvement.We can see Sadhus from all over the country there at times .The place is worth visiting.The way up and down the hill is worth enjoying too.\",\"It is word famous temple of Goddess Durga.Have the opportunity of darshan with a VIP entry ticket in less than half an hour. Pandas are there but they are not greedy.\",\"Good and clean ambience. Pandas and purohits are far better than other temples in India. Darshan was well organized.\",\"Liked the cave - inside . Did not like too many pandits and the business .it could more and better organized ,could be made a little cleaner . May be more facilities for the devotees to sit and meditate .\",\"Visiting Kamakhya Devi Temple was the highlight of our Guwahati - Shillong trip. It's a beautiful temple perched on Nilanchal mountain and is easily accessible by road from Guwahati city centre (it's on way to airport). You can reach main entrance gate either by car or you can climb the stairs starting at the moutains base (though it may not be a safe option). From main entrance gate temple is around 500 mtrs (mix of plain path and stairs - easy to medium difficulty level). Unlike other temple's in India, we didn't face the Panda menace here, though they were present but didn't trouble us much. For darshan, one may opt for normal que (wait time is over 5-6 hours on normal days i.e. no festival / public holidays) and special que - Rs. 500 ticket (wait time will be 1-2 hrs) or you may contact one of the pandas who will get you darshan done in 15-20 mins @ 1,000-1,500 per person (on normal days). Since, animal sacrifice is still a practice at this temple, sighting of same may not be easy for some. But go for the divine and soulful experience which will last for the lifetime \\ud83d\\ude4f\\u263a\\ufe0f Jai maa Kamakhya...\",\"Quite a neat place. Not much disturbance by Pandas. Had a nice darshan of the Sati peeth. Prayed. Hope for blessings.\",\"Went to my in-laws in Guwahati for Durga Puja from Mumbia.\\n\\nA day before Durga Puja - started early for devine darshan of Maa Kamakhya with my wife and 10 months old daughter. Opted for a paid queue of Rs 151/-. The entire queue was ill-maintained. Once you enter the CAGE like structure, there is no turning back. You stand for hours and there is no exit if you have an emergency. Top risk of lives incase there is any hazard like fire or stemped - god forbid.\\n\\nJust in from of the queue, the was a shad where cows and goats being slaughtered. That was a bloody and horrific sight. Poor All pandaas where there just to mint money some how or the other.\\n\\nAfter waiting for four hours we decided to return without darshan. We prayed from heart and left the temple with a broken heart and tortured heart.\\n\\nI am sure Maa is aware of the pains the poor animals go through. She'll do the justice.\\nJai Mata Di.\\n\\n-- Ashish Sharma\",\"I visited this place for the 1st time 7 years ago and was dismayed at the state of one of the famous shrines in India. Dirty, No maintenance and some very rude and greedy preist (Panda) as they are known. This place attracts thousands of tourist evry year. Its high time Assam Government take measures to maintain a clean and peaceful environment in there.\",\"Everytime I go there I find mental peace and it is such a place that you will find no cheating by the Pujaris/Pandas like other religious places.\",\"holy place to visit situated on top hill, beautiful city view from here. if u want fast darshan get tatkal darshan . crowded place .The pandas are good and helpful, they dont extract money like in so many religious locations.\",\"Visit to Kamakhya Temple was a great experience. like any other old religious places in India i expected that Panda would flock you, and squeeze me for money. we found very different, on 1st day the Panda who gave us information, flowers, did not ask for any money, and when we concluded the puja also he did'nt demand any money, offcouse i gave him suitable amount. But there was no rushing. we were at the temple at 7 AM and had used the VIP line, but overall nice experience,\",\"Kahamkhya Temple is one of the shaktipeeths.

must visit place if you head to North East. .. a well known temple...situated at top of small hill...you feel like in paradise..facilities might not be upto mark but still it's worth every second of your time..\",\"I visited this place when i was 12 with my family, i liked this place so much that i want to visit this place once again.\\nI recommand to visit this place with family i guaranteed you will enjoy it.\",\"Nice temple good architecture building with unique designing healthy food peaceful accommodation also available\",\"divine temple..old architecture..good road to the temple..nice view of the city feom the temple..wishes will surely come true..\",\"The place was quite clean compared to many Hindu temples that I have visited. It had very nice peaceful vibes and it did have that special aura which shaktipeeths have. It was a nice feeling to be there and the temple has a very old feel to it though many parts have been added to make it more accessible.\",\"Visit here was so enchanting that till the time I was here I felt out of this world. This place is so Devine that you will also fall in Devine love with this place.\",\"A divine aura surrounds this entire temple complex. An interesting legend and undated history surrounds this holy place. Usually it takes several hours for a glimpse of the \\u2018Sakthi Peetha\\u2019 but today (November 8, Thursday) I reached the place at 3 PM and was extremely lucky and blessed to finish my darshan in 20 minutes!\\n\\nOf course a blissful experience that is humanly impossible to describe, I would urge anyone visiting Guwahati to pay a visit to the Goddess Kamakhya.\",\"This is a very crowded place.  Just like in all temples you will have to take your shoes off.  We left our socks on and some of the locals were not happy about that.Worth visiting if you have not seen any other temples.\",\"Historic place and a major attraction of not only this region but the country, All cannot be explained but a visit will make you feel where you were. Never miss this will be a life time experience.\",\"Very satisfactory ,well organised, helpful people, premises neat and clean, dedicated priest. No compulsion on their part..\",\"As a tourist, you will find it dirty, crowded and not pleasant at the first sight. But that's what it's all about. Don't expect to explore thoroughly the inside but the outside is what you can expect from a real temple. It's not made for tourists and that's what is good.\",\"First temple roof in d shape of a dome. Read wikipedia for info why this temple was built. Did not go inside the temple coz of fuzzy toddler.\",\"I wanted to visit the place because of its Historic importance, but was totally disappointed when i reached there.\\nonce we get down at parking, haven to walk for some distance. all through the way we could see only shops selling all forms of godly material. This place is definitely not for an atheist.\",\"I went to Kamakhya Temple. The Kamakhya temple is beautifully designed with simple yet elegant carvings which are lightly decorated with colourful flowers. The temple has a massive dome which overlooks the quaint Nilanchal Hills in the background. It is great place to go.\",\"This great temple can be visited from early morning. Even at 7 am, though there was a huge crowd, the place was very well organised. The inner sanctum really feels devine.\",\"Nice, well maintained, old temple. one of the sakhthipeet, very nice to visit. temple premises are good.\",\"The only good thing about this place is the Temple itself and the beautiful architecture of the Central Shine.Not to mention the views of the City in the evenings from the Top . The priests within the temple tend to fleece people for money in exchange for blessings. If you visit the temple it should only be for the Temple architecture and the views you get of the city, nothing else.\",\"Great devotional place. But very very poorly managed. Huge crowd, no rain/sun management. Beautiful way to reach upto it. Of great religious value!\",\"Clean n serene exterior surroundings.Nice experience.This temple is situated on the top of the hill.This temple is very famous and tourist attraction of Assam.Oneof the oldest temple,very good place but over crowded..photography not allowed in the temple.Amazing place for worshipping Maa  Kamakhyudevi.one of the 51 shaktipeeths.\",\"We went there to offer prayers, it is in the hill,  roads are nice and we'll maintained. Inside temple is clean.  Have well parking space for traveller. On the way towards temple you will enjoy good scenic beauty.\",\"Well organised place of holy faith, we seldom find such cleanliness and such organised management in shrines and holy places.\",\"one of my local team mate taken me to K Temple i was wonderful experience , if you are with family you must visit this temple\",\"Its wanderful experiance while travelling in Kamakhya temple. Ha ha HA aha haha ha h ah yuy  yusdiu uiasuu.\",\"One of the concerns I usually have when visiting temples is how well are we maintaining a place of great believe and massive significance - this temple I would say is quite well maintained. The Gopuram looks good and has a history across kings.\\nThe only concern I have is pandits/pujaris still looking for ways to get dakshina.\\nThe place get huge queues and is maintained quite decently.\",\"A warm welcome awaits any western visitor to this colourful and very busy Hindu temple. It lies on the edge of the city and the road up the hill provides wonderful views of the area.\",\"Best temple of city. Very nice place.

Our package tour operator had warned us we wouldn't have time to stand in the queue, and to enter through Gate No.2, where we could get darshan quickly, albeit from a little away.\\n\\nAs our vehicle neared the hill temple, there was very heavy rain. Everyone rushed for shelter. The roads became empty of two wheelers and pedestrians. We got off before the parking area, braved the rain, and ran from the awning/covering of one shop to another, on the street leading to the temple entrance. Entry through Gate 2, made us skip the queue and took us to within 3 meters of the sanctum, where we got good darshan, as there were hardly less people inside the temple, thanks to the heavy downpour. No ticket or payment was required anywhere.\\n\\nAs it was eve of Bihu, or the local new year, the temple buildings were all decorated with colorful flowers from top to bottom -- an incredible sight. Thankfully the rains ceased and we could go around the complex and enjoy the fresh cleaned look everywhere.\\n\\nOn the way down we stopped at a view point and could see Guwahati town and the Brahmaputra River below -- a panoramic view not to be missed.\",\"Kamakhya Temple is a wonderful place to visit.\\n\\nIt has a terrific waiting lines and this makes you tired, but the after darshan you feel yourself relaxed.\",\"Situated on Top of the hill outside the city very famous temple.

If you take a bigger water bottle, he will not fill it for you, hence need to take the smallest one. I keep my head on the garba graha and had a heart filled darshan.\\n\\nNow came out, there was free meals, filled my stomach. Once again went to the maruti car, I said i will go in the jeep, since it is rs.10/-, astonishingly the driver said give me rs.10/- only, Arrived at the hill basement in 10 minutes,\\n\\nNow trip to another shakti peeth dirgeshwari.\\nAt the arch basement, buses which go towards guwahati, you need to take those buses, stopping name is fashion bazaar, the bus stops at the river side, now at the river, went from one end of the shore to other to ply me to durga mandir, One end of the river boat driver said, that end river boat will take you, Ultimately got one.

Do not seek outside poojari help.\\nBuy special pooja ticket during rush hours\",\"Kamakhya Temple is one of the three Shakthipeets in the North East (I think the other two are, as far as I know, the Durga Temple of Narthiang, near Jowai, Meghalaya and also the Tripuri temple in Tripura, Agartala). I have not visited Agartala so far but I have visited the Narthiang one, which is a small temple mainteined by a Bengali family and the temple comes alive specially on the Durga Puja days.\\nThe Kamakhya Temple is one of the oldest Durga temples in the North East and its location on the Nilachal Hill facing the mighty Brahmaputra river is significant. I have visited Kamakhya at least 4 or 5 times during the past 22 years of my stay in the North East. Initially when I was in Silchar teaching in Assam University, I heard from a Bengali friend about the religious significance of the temple and hence sought the help of my friends to visit the same. So, once, en route to our catching the train from Guwahati to Chennai we visited the temple. Of course since none except me was interested in visiting the temple shrine, I had to make it alone. I was caught by a Panda, who helped me to enter upto the shrine and see the Ma Durga.Howver it did not make an impact on me, since it is very different from the South Indian temples. I was more interested in the temple's that gave us an enchanting view of the great Brahmaputra River. We used to walk past the temple uphill to choose a quiet spot from which we could see the brimming silver waters of the river and the calm environ around.\\nThen sometimes to engage the visitors from the South we would take them to Kamakhya and which always proved to be a harrowing experience, especially if it was festival days or auspicious days. The best time to visit Kamakhya, I learnt then, is either early in the morning (before 8.30 am or late in the evening, say after 4.30 pm or 5, so that you don't need wait in the queue for a long time. In Tirupathi also the wait in the queue is longer, but you do not feel the experience harrowing, since there is so much architectural beauty that you watch. But in Kamakhya, most of the walls are dirty and not much maintenance is there. The priests can be nasty too if you do not hurry up and leave your prasad DOWN in the shrine and pull out your prasad too quickly.You will understand what I mean here when you visit. There is a belief that if you put your hand in and pull out flowers or anything as prasad from the waters in the shrine, will bring you good luck.\\nI never go near the Bali peet, an enclosure that you will see as you come around the temple, since I just hate the site of blood from the hens or goats, atc, which devotees offer. You can read more on this from Indira Goswami's story on Kamakhya.\\nWhat I love the most about the temple is the architecture of the building - the spiral kind of architecture, with greyish hue with doves all around was a scenic environment. They say here that a visit to the temple changes one's life. I do not whether it is true. But certainly it is worth a visit at least once.\",\"Kamkhya is one of the shakti peeth of Hindus. The temple is a must visit. There are VIP passes also available but the counter closes at 9.30am itself. Sir I g peak season and rush days the passes finishes earlier. There are special discounts for armed personnel. The pass for general public is for 500rs, if you are in a rush and you can afford it.. then its better to buy the pass. Because the queues are really long with hundreds of devotees reaching the temple at 5am itself.\\n\\nA little ahead of Kamkhya there are two more temples. One can take a local.cab for 200rs and visit those temples. Ola cabs can be easily hired in Guwahati.\",\"Kamakhya temple is one of the most revered place of Hindus and a must for them if they are visiting Guwahati.\\nOne of the total 51 shakti peeths-Kamakhya is situated a top neelanchal hill.\\nAs there are longe queue one need to get up early and reach temple about 7AM.\\nAfter taking tickets usually it takes 1 hr to reach Garbha Griha and perform puja.\\nDarshan was smooth and it was really blissful and satisfying.\",\"Kamakhya Temple is called the main \\\"Sati Pith\\\" among the 51 different ones distributed all over Asia.

But be sure to come in early hours with lots of time in hand if you want to want to do the Puja.\",\"Situated at Neelachal, this shakti-pitha is a must visit for every hindu pilgrim because of its linkage with Shiva-Sati mythology.

Apart from this, cab is also available which will cost around Rs.200. It will take 30 minutes to reach Kamakhya from Guwahati.

We have to walk a little distance from the car park. There is usually a long queue for darshan, but we purchased a 501/- Rs ticket which allowed us to get in a shorter queue line.\\nThe temple is a old one and many practice animal sacrifice in the temple. It is done openly, so take care if you are sensitive towards such issues.\\nThere are clean washrooms and toilets which are free to use and shops just outside the temple.

Its  better to get a Pandit ji ( Called Panda's) to help with the puja. inside the temple is cramped and crowded , so if someone is claustrophobic avoid going inside. Though i love going to the place , I hate so many pandits inside the temple asking for money . if you pay even Rs 100 , they are not happy . they will ask you for rs 500 , rs 1000 etc.other than this I kust love the place .\",\"The temple was pretty crowded and the road leading to the temple filled with chances to buy the materials for puja and beautifully colourful\",\"It was always my wish to visit the holy Kamakhya temple. I was accompanied by a pandya who helped me in all aspects. I took a ticket of Rs 501 and had to stand in a queue for 15 mins. Could provide an excellent puja to the Devi and could touch the holy water inside. If you are having a ticket of 101 you have to stand for 3-4 hours for giving the puja. Carry drinking water. Also photography is banned inside the main temple, however you can take photos outside the temple.\",\"The temple gets very crowded, its best to visit as early as possible. Try to get the paid tickets, will take lesser time to offer pujas..\",\"This temple is the most important shaktipeeth in India.

Maa Kamakhya Temple is an ancient temple and one of the famous of 51Shakti Peeth of Devi Sati.Inside the temple there is a sacred feeling and once you are inside the Garbh Greah...it is out of the world experience. There are two ways you can enter the temple.\\n1st : Common line...it will take 2-3hrs atleast, and\\n2nd : Special Entry.. which is chargeable @501 per head...it will take 45mins to 1hr, depending upon the rush at that hour.\\nMy advice is, you should visit the temple in the morning, and after that should have a taste of Bhog they provide which is free of cost( Bhog is available from 12-3pm only). Thus make sure you complete your darshan before this time so that you can have Bhog. Panda's in this temple are quite good, and do not force you or irritate you for the rituals to perform when you are inside the temple. But make sure if you are performing the rituals, you bargain before hand so that you do Puja peacefully.\\nPrasad, Flowers, Chunari etc. you can buy from any stall as per your wish and budget.\\nOverall my personal experience was very nice and was lucky to be blessed by Maa Kamakhya.\",\"Every one should take Darshan of Kamakhya Devi.

During December cold it opened before six. You can hire any Ola or Uber Cab and go there directly at Parking and leave that. On your return you can get fresh Cab easily as cabs stays at parking. If you know Panda before then it is easy otherwise also you can visit alone. Better to take Rs 500 or Rs 100 line. General line will take hours. You can get out within a hour in the morning.\",\"Amazing vive inside the temple. Too much crowd but that can be handled. If you know somone or have some bureaucratic/Military/Political connection inform the DC office for your arrival a day in advance.\\notherwise for everyone it is mandatory to buy a pass for INR500 per person for quick Darshan (3-4 hours). Avoid going on Bihu, Dussehra. Always get a local priest who wopuld accompany you for the darshan. Remember the tiocket counter starts selling ticket from 6am but yiu bettr be early in the queue or else you may miss out.\\nOverall complete memerizing and stunning experience. Definitely would love to go again.\\ntemple administration is very helpful ad if you are with a child less than 8 years you can get a VIP darshan wityhoit any extra cost. Just inform the temple admninistration. The office is located in the temple opremises but it opens up at 9 am.\",\"It's hard to find a clean temple in India with large number of devotees visiting temples all hours of the day but Kamakhya surprised me. The outer complex was quite clean to walk barefoot. A number of lamps and bells on the temple walls amused me. Though the same cannot be said about the inner part of the temple. It was really dark inside the temple with suffocating heat. Even the stairs were not lit well which was quite risky. The cleanliness was nowhere to seen inside. The priests may ask you to donate specified amount whether you are willing or not. Except the donation part, the temple is good to visit.\",\"Kamakhya as the name goes, go with your wishes and never come back empty handed. Yes but you have to bear the long que to have the darshan.\\n\\nYou have VIP lines which you may avail by paying 500 rupees per individual. That will take you less time. Army nationals have their separate ques to enter the temple.\\n\\nAvoid Tuesdays and Saturday rush hours since considered as sacred pilgrimage days.\\n\\nYou have a bhog facility available outside the mandir premises where you are made to sit in a room and then given away tokens to collect your thali at your own. Its free. It will have kichdi, Alu dam, Payesh, Papad.\\n\\nFlowers and other offerings are well available at every nook and corner of the temple. No need to avail a pandit and thus avoid when they call you for offerings. You can offer at your own and touch the sacred water inside the dark room.\",\"if you are in Guwahati & u havent visited Kamakhya temple then it is a waste of your trip. but whenever you visit make sure that you have a lot of time in your hands. also try to visit early in the morning when you can find limited special entry tickets worth Rs.500/- which can assure you less wait time for darshan. if you know a panda, tell him to book tickets in advance.\",\"Kamakhya Devi has her complete blessing on us that day as I along with my in-laws went there to seek her blessings.Usually, in our country, worshiping at a Shakti-peeth is a strenuous affair, where we have to fight our way to get a glimpse of a devi. But I was really impressed by the systematic way in which the crowd of devotees are handled at Kamakhya Devi temple. You need to purchase a pass, either general or a VIP pass. Thereafter you would be taken to a seating area and would be asked to wait. after that as per our general or VIP passes we would be frisked away to our queues. Mind you, the general or VIP lines are only because of the price of the passes. The VIP pass doesn't give you any special privilege to worship the Devi. After some point of time both the lines converge to be one. Only advantage is that the VIP pass being costlier has a lesser queue and you would reach the entry of the Temple earlier than the people who have the general pass. Once inside you would be mesmerized by the beauty of the temple. It is an ancient temple and you would really feel walking back in time. The devotees are managed very well and everything is very disciplined. I had a precious few seconds to spend with Kamakhya Maa and seek her blessings. A tip, try to get a good pundit who would guide you and explain each and every ritual, like we did. Would definitely come back here again when in Guwahati.\",\"Holy temple in the top of the kamakhya hill,I liked the trip from the main road to the temple and public transport cabs are readily available.\",\"Kamakhya temple has a huge complex with long queue for garbhashaya Darshan. Tourists should take VIP route so as to save 3-4 hours. One can simply have Darshan from outside also with help of a pujari. Nothing great in terms of architecture so can be missed altogether if you not too religious, but then nothing else to do in Guwahati.\",\"Kamakhya temple is a revered temple among northeast and eastern part of India. It has lot of religious significance. As with any other famous temple, Kamakhya temple is very crowded and it takes hours to get darshan. There are VIP passes available but only in limited number, once those passes get over, counter is closed. Darshan is quicker if you visit early in the morning and able to get a VIP pass.

Kamakhya station is also very nearby and almost all superfast trains are having  stopage there. The taxies and buses go upto the temple complex.

VIP passes are available at Rs.500/- per person in limited numbers twice daily  -  morning around 7:00 AM and afternoon around 2:00 - 2:30 pm., however queues for that starts much before than actual time of distribution. One also needs bargaining with pandas for darshan. Average time taken for darshan by General line is 5 - 6 hours and 2 - 3 hours by VIP line. This may increase by atleast 2 - 3 hours on weekends or special holy days. Pandas can also arrange Puja in a shortcut manner by visit of god from outside without entering 'Garbhagriha '. Inside temple one should remain cautious from pandas as they may try to extort money in the name of god, but those numbers are very few.

I followed  the queue for Darshan, on enquiring, I was informed that we will reach Goddess Kamashya Devi for darshan in about 3 Hours. I took some snaps over there. Usual as at religious places, but in comparison things are cheaper, footwear care Rs5/-,, Bag care Rs10/- closer to temple. Restaurants are also cheaper, Rs7/- per Samosa. It was nice visit and memorable while returning I bought Bamboo wood articles viz.

The temple closes at 5pm and we went there at 4:30pm and saw that there wasn't much of a crowd there. We entered the Temple,offered puja to the deity and prayed inside. The priests over here have no demands for money. Photography is allowed in the temple compound but not within the main temple itself.\",\"Visited this holy temple in Dec-17. This was my first visit to this temple. It is located in vicinity of Guwahati city. Though, share bus/car service is available from main city to this temple, but we decided to take app based cab to save time. Presently Guwahati city going through major development programme, so frequent traffic jam are usual these days. So, it\\u2019s recommended to take sufficient buffer time to deal with traffic jam. Further, the road to temple has many turns similar to any hilly road. Thus, necessary precaution is mandatory if anyone has motion sickness. Cab/car/bus is not allowed beyond parking place. Considering the number of devotees visiting this temple, I felt, parking place is not sufficient. Further, many bus are also using the same parking space which makes the place bit crowdy.\\n\\nIn our case, it tool around 45-50 min to reach the temple from Lachit Nagar, Guwahati. We released the cab at parking and proceed to temple by walk. It took 10 min to reach main entrance gate. In this road, Puja items and Prasad are available. Anyone could purchase Prasad (stating from Rs. 51) as per their wish. During this approach road, many priest (Panda) told that they would take us inside the temple in minimum time. However, we already contacted one priest from Guwahati, thus, for us this selection was not required.\\n\\nIn Kamakhya temple, there are there ques to enter into the main temple. 1) General entry which doesn\\u2019t required any entry fee 2) VIP entry which required entry fee of Rs. 500 per person and 3) Entry for Army personal. This temple used to be over crowed in Tuesday, Saturday, partly Sunday and any special occasion. There are instances, when after paying VIP entry fee, devotee waited 4-5 hrs in Que. Thus, anyone can imaging the time required in general ques in those days. So, for hassle free Puja, my recommendation is plan accordingly (is possible).\\n\\nWe visited this temple in Thursday, so our time consumption was half an hour from standing in que to completion of Puja. In that day, general que took only 1.5 hours for the same. Inside the temple, light is very low and we have to get down 15-20 stairs. Aged people are frequently visiting this temple, so safeguarding is must. Otherwise, they may get hurt. In front of Maa Kamakhya idol, other priests are already there for Puja. Then I realized that in this temple, \\u201cPanda service\\u201d is not mandatory which required additional expanse. Anyone could use the que and extend his/her puja without any Panda. In this temple, \\u201cKumari Puja\\u201d is also available. Generally newlywed couple are offering this puja.\\n\\nPost Puja, we took a quick tour of entire temple. Temple premise was very clean and work done by temple admiration is appreciable. After that we entered into Prasadalaya where free Prasad is available for all. It is located just beside the approach road to temple. Coupon is available at the entry gate and quality and quantity of food was very good. My recommendation is please have the Prasad during your visit.\\n\\nOverall, we were very satisfied and recommend all to visit this holy place.\",\"The Sakti Pith is one of the main attractions for the people of North-East and India. Nothing for international tourists to explore here except during the Kumb Mela. THe Temple does get crowded and on a Free Entry Line, it might take upto 4-5 hrs to perform darshan but there are a variety of entry tickets from Rs.100 to Rs.1000 which can cut down your Pooja time upto 10 mins. Dont fall for the many Pandits sitting inside and outside the Temple in front of God(ess) statutes asking for Offerings/Donation.\\nThe view Uphill and Downhill are very mesmerizing.\",\"It would not be wrong if I say that Kamakhya temple is the heart and soul of Guwahati.

There are lots of shops lined in the way to the temple from the parking lot selling puja essentials. The temple is beautiful too, specially the domes. It is too crowded though. You will need to stand in queue for 4-5 hours if you go for normal darshan (that's the best because then you get access to the garbha) You can also opt for the VIP ticket which costs Rs. 500/- for a quick darshan.

It will really make u feel lite when u visit kamakhya mata.  Both,  Spiritually and physically.  The pandas ensure you would be left lite at your pocket.

Some prasad from shops outside will allow u free shoe layoff service. I would advice minimum expenditure  and maximum time soend there will allow you to enjoy the visit.  Cameras are not allowed in main Mandirs main premises but you may carry it along.  There are three lines for darshan main for the common bakht,  the second  one for fauji brothers and the third one is for vips which all rich and every second person in India is.

As expected, it\\u2019s a divine experience to be there and to take part in offering Puja to God.  Since it was during the Puja days, the temple area was over crowded.  Somehow, we managed to reach everywhere barring the main \\u201carea\\u201d, since; the main door was closed much before we reached the temple.  Thus, try to avoid those Durga Puja days to be here.

It is old and rich with stories and history, which is intriguing and you could read about it. Here's how the visit looked and felt. I visited Kamakhya temple when I had an afternoon off while at work in Guwahati. July afternoon, it had just started raining when I set out for the temple. The taxi driver told me it was particularly auspicious if it rains when you visit, the goddess really wants to you to visit and prayers bring fruit on such lucky instances ... started with one of the interesting background stories :) The ride up the hill was beautiful, picturesque. There are 2 view points on the way up and you can request for a photostop or just to take in the view. Takes about 10 minutes to the top. The way up had some more markers for other temples, that I would have loved to explore but did not have the time and chance, but I remain curious because hardly any vehicles were headed on any alternate paths. There a full-fledged bus/auto/taxi stand right outside the temple, which is great ,because If you Uber-ed to the top, you may not be able to do the same for the way back ... wi-fi/internet connectivity is really poor/zero at the top of the hill.\\n\\nThe temple itself ... crowded, messy, mayhem. If you've visited Dakhshineshwar/ Kalighat in Kolkata...it feels almost the same, the moment you step out of your ride, some one is trying to sell you flowers, prasad, a VIP fast-track entry ... same, same!\\n\\nIt's a market place... the beauty finishes after the ride up, there's concerete constructions -- apartments, hotels/lodges all around and that seemed to drawf the temple. Inside, is a huge open area,\\nThere is an outer shrine and an inner shrine, The Inner shrine is the most revered which draws the huge number of devotees.\\n\\nI went right before the Ambubachi festival and the average wait time was insane. There are these narrow enclosures with snaking queues up and down the slope, I asked a devotee exiting after his darshan at 4 pm how long he'd waited in the queue and he said since 5 am. So, honestly, I didn't even consider attempting.\\n\\nThere's a VIP ticket for quicker access which was closed because the crowd was too much. It would cost Rs.100/- if its open. (Also, you can't ride up closer to the time of Ambubachi festival because lakhs of people visit and all climb by foot at that time.)\\n\\nThere was this other option of a priest who would go inside (they can skip queues!!) & pray on your behalf. He will bring you some pink-tinted water in a ziploc bag -- that's the holy water from the inner shrine. He also shared his mobile number and offered to retain & send across a piece of the Goddess's red cloth after Ambubachi festival for a dakshina (service fee for offering prayers -- as understood best by me)...very, very interesting, like I said :)\\n\\nThe outer wall has statues of Siva and Parvati and one of Lord Ganesha, that are worshiped. There are some outer temples, smaller ones dedicated to other Gods, which are not crowded at all, so I visited one of those.\\n\\nAgain, what I loved most was the ride up to the hill. The number of devotees and the sheer devotion to see the shrine was what held me in awe, and I hope I carried back the blessings of the Goddess...The enormity of it all...the structure, the faith, the Goddess's story, and the history of it from the scriptures is an experience in itself.\",\"Belongs to 10th century, the temple stands tall and majestic. Located close to city, it is a must see. One of the most sacred Sakthi peeths. Sundays will see lot of rush. Best time to visit: early morning on week days.

It's always crowded and you can do Pooja with help of Pandits. You can take VIP line which cost 500/person, general and defense line. We took so called  VIP line as mandir was so crowded and we could miss our flight. Temple closes at 1.30 -3.30 so plan accordingly. It becomes little difficult with young ones in queues waiting for turn to come for darshan.\",\"Our review is strictly based on the arrangements/facilities available in the temple.\\nThe normal queue takes about 4 hours, and the special queue (Rs 500 per person) will take you approx 2hrs for the darshan. We took the services of a Pandit referred fby Baruah Bhawan, where we stayed in Guwahati but we were not pestered by any other Pandits at the gate which is a rarity in India. The temple area was quite clean.There are separate designated places for diyas and incense sticks and nothing except flowers are allowed inside the main temple. The main temple is small and especially the shakti peeth area is very dark, so be careful. The pandits sitting at the Shakti peeth do ask for dakshina.\\nPost visit we had prasad/bhog just outside the temple. The arrangement was fantastic, there is waiting area with enough chairs where you can keep shoes, and they give free tokens for bhog. They also manage the crowd well by letting in only a group of 30-40 ppl at a time. Very clean plates, food served is delicious and separate areas for ladies to sit and men to stand and have lunch.\\nVisit early to avoid rush, Uber is easily available to and fro this temple and hence better not to book a cab for entire visit. Being Indians and having visited many temples in India we found this one to be the best.\\nWe missed the museum though.\",\"This was a very quick visit on my way from Airport to the city. The can leaves you at the entry of the temple area  from where you have to walk up Ard 500 mtr. And if u wish to see the brahmaputra then another km. The Prasad is available at the entry also. And you need to take off ur shoes before entering the temple premises. The token of Rs. 5 is available next to the entry on left so give ur shoes their and go for darshan , lots of Pabditji ( Panda ) will lure you for a VIP darshan in 500/- , it makes sense if u in hurry. The temple opens at 6 and closed in the evening Ard 5. Last entry at4:30. And lunch time closed at 2. So plan accordingly\",\"Kamakhya is a one of the femous Pitasthan of Devi ( Godees ) Durga mata. This is situated at out side of Guwahati town of Assam state of India. From Guwahati town it takes around half an hour by road vehicle. This is on the small hilly area. This is known as area of Tantra Sadhna. Meny tantrik are achive their gole here. The main place of the attraction is in the cave which is very very dark and can go by stairs . The stairs are very slippery and weight so be carefull to go for Darshan. You may spend more time for darshan because every time you find long que in normal way. But you spend some money the pandas will help you to avoid long que and darshan will be at another way to save your time. Also be carefull from some panda who are ready to cheat you. Afterall you feel bhaktibhab surely.\",\"Kamakhya temple is located at Nilachal Hills within the city and approximately 6-7 km from Guwahati railway station. it is regarded among the most auspicious temples Unlike other Hindu temples around India here you don't face the scary pandas (priests). They will no doubt approach you but, If you don't seek their service they won't push or hang around you.\\n\\nThis is among few Indian temples where foreigners are not barred from entering.\\n\\nMost of the days the place remains packed with pilgrims from throughout India and neighbouring countries. It is best to avoid all holidays if you are a new to the place. The main temple opens at 8 am but as devotees come in great numbers it is better to start at early hours, say by sunrise, the best time to proceed as rush picks up with passage of light.\\n\\nOne can avail bus from Kachari bus stand (half a km from Guwahati railway station) that shuttles between the temple and the city at regular interval, or pick any auto-rickshaw from any part of the city or hire car from below the foothill that runs throughout the day from as early as 5 am till late evening up-till 8 pm. Sometimes even beyond the mentioned period. There are various other temples around within a km from the main temple which also provides fabulous natural views of surroundings.\\n\\nMy suggestions are, if you are capable of walking, walk at least one way down through either the main road or people who are adventurous walk up-down the designated foot road. it is not only enjoyable but also makes you watch the wonderful natural view. The road is absolutely safe for all, so if you find an empty road don't get scared but enjoy to your delight.\\n\\nFor photographers the place offers some magnificent spots for photography. A few spots are located on way to Bhubaneswari temple.\\n\\nFor devotees best period to visit is during Ambabuchi or Ambubachi festival held during the month of June when one can come close to watching Naga Sanyasi (Sadhu or Monk).\\n\\nAttention:\\n\\n1.

No need to keep on hire taxi or auto-rickshaw as plenty of cars ply down the road\\n5. There is a Govt. run dispensary close-by to attend to any emergency\\n6. General queues are large and non-chargeable or you can enter by paying Rs 100 or Rs 500 to get inside the temple promptly. However, now-a-days those queues too are long. Therefore, check the queue before you decide.\\n7. Lodging facilities are available around for devotees\",\"You can reach the temple by taxi, auto rickshaw or even public buses. For visiting the temple one can keep their shoes in one of the shops selling puja materials.Apart from general queue, there are paid queues also.Rs 501 and Rs 50 for Defence/paramilitary personnel. The waiting depends upon type of visitor. During Navaratras the the temple door opens at 9.00 AM otherwise at 8 AM.  There are many Pandas avilable if one wants to perform puja. Animal sacrifice is also done here. The arrangements for darshan is quite systemetic, there were no problems when I had visited, the priests were not hurrying up the devotees like in other temples. The temple and its surroundings were quite clean.\",\"We visited this Shakti-Peeth on the Neelachal hills just on the outskirts of the city of Guwahati, the capital city of the state of Assam, INDIA on the 30th March, 2019.

According to me a person visiting Guwahati must visit Kamakhya Temple and worship Maa Kamakhya. It is said that Goodess Kamakhya fulfills ones wishes and makes ones future bright if worshipped whole heartedly. Reaching Kamakya from Paltan Bazar is very Easy. You can board a bus from Paltan Bazar going towards maligaon to reach Kamakhya Bus Stand. The fare is as cheap as RS 7 . Thereafter One need to get into a share cab or bus to reach the gate of the Temple. The cab costs 50 for one while the bus costs 10 for one.

A beautiful wonderful temple, be it structurally or architecturally. A holy place, definitely meant for a profound peaceful prayer for those God seekers.

Some might argue it\\u2019s one off but it\\u2019s a bitter pill to swallow, the experience was too bad. Very bad indeed.\\nAs we wanted to visit and obviously offer prayers at the temple, we went as early as 4.30am. Queued to get the special pass, though had to wait but happy as I was the second in line. However, just when the counter opened , the priests the elderly ones were willing to cut queue to get special passes for those willing to part with a few rupees. Cut queue they did. I was number 9 or 10 by then.\\nOther inconsiderate ones placed their family members at the entrance gate, blocked of the passage way and went over to get the tickets. Those with tickets had to wait, haggle, squeeze and in the process the weaker ones pushed way back further behind. We had to push through which was next to impossible. Somehow managed to. Pity my wife and my 13 year old daughter.\\n\\nThen on entry we thought we could perform our prayer peacefully. But no, was not possible. Every priest stuck to their chosen visitors like a leech would and seemed to do archanai, at every deity.\\nOn top of that other priests waited with their yellow cloth spread at every corner forcing us to perform a prayer as they instructed and money was required to be given. Expected minimum RS100. Crazy! INR 20 not welcomed!\\nWhen we do not we were scolded. Luckily I do not understand Hindi! How do one say their prayer in this circumstances - absence of peace of mind.\\nFinally we were out some 45 minutes later. Once out the priest who stuck to us like a leech asked for INR 2500. Not only is but another couple of families. When I refused one can imagine the ugly scene that would follow. Beyond explanation.\\n\\nTemple is beautiful, very suitable for a outing with family. Excellent place of religion but than it\\u2019s the human factor that makes it difficult.\\n\\nPrayers are difficult to perform for the simple reason of money vs peace of mind.\\n\\nOne should visit but just be vigilant and don\\u2019t fall prey to anyone imposters there especially the priests.\",\"This is a one of the important shakti peeth, you can read about the temple in detail on Web.

Outside is more relaxed - the temple walls have striking sculptures, the courtyard is full of devotees, happy after the darshan and tree still spreads its shade over them.\",\"This place is considered one of the most holy temples in India. Thousands of devotee flock the temple each day to offer their prayers. The number is really astonishing. There are three ways to visit the deity, each line having separate tickets costing Rs 50, 100 and 500 respectively. I am not sure whether there is another ticket costing more than Rs 500. The number of people and thus the waiting time in each queue is inversely proportional to the ticket cost, ie. if you have Rs 500 ticket you get to enter the Garbhagriha and offer your Puja much earlier along with less number of people than if you choose Rs 100 line. So, be prepared to shell out a hefty sum of money if you are not willing to stand in queue for the whole day. Literally even in off-season, it may take 5-6 hours to complete your 'Darshan'. The main room where the deity is kept (Garbhagriha) has very narrow rim of area surrounding a centrally placed idol...some people are allowed to enter at a time and the rest in queue wait outside. Those who enters inside are again made to follow many queue which goes in serpentine fashion and encircles the room twice or thrice before reaching near the deity. It is dangerous to have two or three queues of men and women side by side in the narrow alley of a space of 'garbhagriha' as anytime a stampede may result. There are insufficient lights and no cross ventilation inside the main temple. The queue for Rs 100 and 50 wait in narrow enclosed corridors with the end of such corridor kept close with collapsible gate. If someone gets ill while waiting turn in the middle of the queue then its very difficult to extract him/her. The surrounding are not very clean. The Pandas (priests) occasionally hurl abuses if someone gives small amount of 'Pranami' or payment for their worship (which is again not fixed). If you can arrange a VIP pass then everything becomes super-easy. The whole system of getting the blessings of God is controlled by money and power, like every other big temple in India. But despite the huge earnings each day, no steps are taken to make the 'Garbhagriha' or main temple room safe and spacious.\",\"We started from Barauni station in Bihar..\\nWe are totally 12 members of our family started in the morning from Barauni station in Bihar.\\n\\nWe reached at kamakhya station...and booked cab and started to reach at the top of the mountain..\\nPandas are there who will took you to the temple for Darshan of maa kamakhya, and it's famous because the continues water coming from unknown source..\\nYou will be able to view the whole kamakhya city from the temple.. and the Brahamputra river can also be viewed.\\nReally owssom trip..\\ud83d\\ude03\\ud83d\\ude03\",\"The holy place of Maa Kamakhya.

The place is cool and the process to do the puja is well maintained.\",\"Guide for the first timers:\\n1. Plenty of buses are available from the city till the Kamakhya gate at the foothills. There are buses that directly ply till the hill top too. The distance from the foothills to the hill top is approx 2.5 kms.\\n2. Many shared taxis (mainly Maruti Vans) take pilgrims to the hill top at affordable rates.\\n3. For those who are taking their own cars, right now the parking lot is being constructed, so ine has to park the car on the road.\\n4. Once we reach the place where cars are allowed, we have to walk for about 5 minutes to reach the temple. We have to walk on the road for a while. Then it is stairs all the way.\\n5. Shoes are allowed till the main gate of the mandir, which is after climbing the flight of stairs. There are many shops along the way that will say that the shoes are not allowed. That is to lure the pilgrims in keeping shoes at their shop and we end up purchasing the puja essential items from them. Same can be done at the shops near the entrance of the mandir.\\n5. It is a hassle-free mandir, where pandits don't really bother you. They will offer their help but won't press much. Many Pandits are there who will help you for the Pujas.\\n6.

There are govt. roadways bus from kachari Bazar to direct temple. or you can get down by any bus towards Basistha at Kamakhya gate then by auto. It is clean and calm.The Pandas are friendly. Line management system is quite ok.\",\"Kamakhya temple is a must visit if you are in the region. From Guwahati airport, this would be a car ride of around 50 min. The process of entering the main temple is pretty simple but tedious.\\nMethod 1:\\nYou get into the general category of line. People have to wait in the waiting room and the organiser allow a certain batch of people to join the queue. After a short gap they allow the next batch. And so on. But The queue can get scarily long. On a crowded day, people might need to wait as long as 5 hours to get into the temple.\\nMethod 2: Once you enter the temple door, walk straight (keeping the main temple on your right hand) and you will hit a counter for VIP ticket, It cost Rs 500. Once again, the process is same. They will make you sit in a airy and very clean hall. And then they will allow you to join the VIP queue in batches. Basically you are cutting short the otherwise general line by 75% as the VIP line starts from the last gate before entering the temple.\\n\\nOnce you reach the final gate, its is kind of three lane path (two for general) and one of VIP ticket holder. And the organisers allow alternatively people in batches to enter the main temple (or garva griha).\\nThe final stretch of queue is like a cage (so as to stop intruders from breaking the line) and has many fans so to keep the place well aired.\\n\\nOnce you enter the main temple, it is two parts. The first part is a symbolic idol of Ma Kamakhkhya and then you have to walk down a cave ... it is bit dark and narrow (but not majorly claustrophobic) ... once you walk down 10 steps you reach the most sacred area where Ma's Yoni had dropped....you will find couple of priest sitting in there. They will give you prasadi flower from that guarded place and will ask you to dip your hand into the space and touch the natural spring water which always runs through the area. And then you come out.\\n\\nThis is a must experience.\\n\\nFew points to keep in mind:\\n1. It is also difficult to get the VIP ticket, more so, on days like Saturday, Tuesday, Omabossha, after Ambubachchi, and so on.\\nUsually tickets gets sold within minutes of opening the counter which is 7:00 am.\\n2. The safe bet is get in touch with any of the pandya. They will either arrange for VIP ticket for you before you reach the temple if it is during later hours of the day or will arrange from fellow pandya.\\n3. If you are with a pandya, it is usually easier as they will then meet you straight in the garva griha and arrange for offering puja.\\n4. If you are having very old people or very small kid, I would advise that you might choose to not take them in the temple, as even with a VIP ticket, you have to wait for minimum 60-90 min in the queue and the journey through the temple takes around 30-40 min.\\n\\nBut once again, there is great arrangement of water and the temple is remarkably clean.\\n\\nNeedless to say, it is an divine experience.\\n\\nJai Ma Kamakhkhya.\",\"This is a must visit place when you are in Guwahati.

You can use your own cell phones for selfies. The time Inside for darshan is short but I feel like a new person after 5 days here.\\n\\nDefinitely do the darshan.

It is located on the Nilachal Hill, en-route Guwahati town from the airport. The temple has two classes of entry for the general public, free and paid. Paid entry is Rs 500/- per head. The ticket window opens at 6 am, by which time there is already a fairly long queue. Each person is given only 2 tickets so if you are a large group, many of you will have to stand in the queue. After the getting the ticket you are either pushed into a waiting room or ushered into covered stands and made to wait for your turn. Meanwhile, those with free entry are made to wait in an another queue next to the paid queue, to be ushered into the temple by turns depending upon the length of each queue. The temple opens at 8 am after the morning arti (type of prayer) which is not open to public. An animal supposed to be sacrificed after the arti. Expect to wait for anything between 1 hour to many, even if you have a ticket.On entry the temple has a place for offering and puja (prayer). The garbgriha (sanctum sanctorum) has no idol. The entry and exit to garbgriha is through the same steps making the whole process very slow and unorganized.           The temple has the panda (traditional priests) at every step virtually forcing you to make a donation to one God or the other. There are authorized priests who conduct a special puja for a a fee. As per tradition, many pilgrims do Kanya Puja (worship of girl child) there.  Everything you require for Puja is available just outside the temple. As one walks around one can see lambs and pigeons which are sacrificed at the temple. This is not done in open view and I did not see the sacrifices.  There are a few places to eat and 2 hotels near the temple. Washrooms are available but not very clean.\",\"I went to Kamakhya Temple this month with one of my friend.

We heard an announcement at about 10 Am that the VIP(Special) darshan ticket counter is closed(Special darshan ticket costs 500 Rs and i think using this ticket darshan of goddess will be over in about 1-2 hours.) There are seats along the queue to sit and unlike many temple people in queues don't push or jostle here which is good.All were maintaining the queue system which is good. We were out of the temple after darshan at about 2:30 Pm. Priests here don't force for donations and we had the darshan of the goddess in a calm way.                The temple closes for afternoon pooja from about 1:00 pm to 1:45 Pm. I think crowds in afternoon are less so if you have time in afternoon plz reach this temple say by around 2 pm to have darshan as it takes about 5-6 hours in morning for darshan.If you are planning to have darshan in afternoon you can plan to reach this place by 1 pm have free meals and then stand in queue for darshan.                    if you are in Kamakhya during lunch time plz have the free meals served in the temple(Free Lunch time is 12:30-3 Pm i think). This place is situated just a few steps away from exit of temple before the steps. On the day of our visit Kichdi,a gravy dish,pappad and kheer was served for free meals and all tasted good. Plz dont miss the free meals served at the temple.            On the day of our visit a bull was scarified (We cannot see the bull being sacrificed but can see the bull being tied to poles at a place where sacrifice takes place). Also there were many goats tied which were about to be sacrificed.The head of the sacrificed bull was kept inside the temple near the devi .We visited the temple on a navami day so maybe on that day animal sacrifice is done(Not sure if animal sacrifice is done on every day).         Small but religiously an important temple for many Hindu religion followers. Except a few sculptures nothing architecturally beautiful in the temple.         Not many good restaurants near kamakhya temple so if you are coming from Guwahati city in morning i will suggest you to have breakfast in the city itself and then proceed to this temple.\",\"This was the first Shaktipeeth I've ever visited in India though I've been traveling to India for a decade. When I saw a documentary on Kamakhya, I was compelled to visit in person during my next trip to India and I wasn't disappointed. It has an aura of mystique around it that you can literally FEEL in the air the moment you enter the temple walls. We used the \\\"fast pass\\\" to avoid the long line for an additional Rs. 500 per person and it was well worth it. We also engaged the services of a panda that was the personal priest of our driver who helped us through the process and performed pujas for myself, my daughter and son. It was mesmorizing and full of prana. I highly recommend paying a visit to this important Shaktipeeth and experience it firsthand.\",\"I actually visited Kamakhya years back (but the dropdown menu only goes as far back as March 2015, sorry about that) By the time our bus inched halfway up Nilachal hill, i was welcomed by the cool and crisp air and looked forward to more. There was a serene air despite the sheer number of people. We went further up the hill and took pictures at various points. It felt like another hilly state of Northeastern India and i momentarily forgot that i had started out from the hot summery city of Guwahati. We also shopped in the quaint souvenir stores and found interesting bamboo articles on the shelves.\",\"I want the go for kamakhya darshan and the main aim of darshan is \\u0930\\u0915\\u094d\\u0924\\u0935\\u0930\\u094d\\u0923 \\u0935\\u0938\\u094d\\u0924\\u094d\\u0930 \\u092a\\u094d\\u0930\\u0938\\u093e\\u0926\\nI want to confirm whether these \\u0930\\u0915\\u094d\\u0924\\u0935\\u0930\\u094d\\u0923 \\u0935\\u0938\\u094d\\u0924\\u094d\\u0930 \\u092a\\u094d\\u0930\\u0938\\u093e\\u0926 is getting all 365 days or only in/after \\u0905\\u092e\\u094d\\u092c\\u0942\\u0935\\u093e\\u091a\\u0940 parva.\",\"A very famous mandir for many reasons, youtube will be the best source of information.\\nProcedure- Hire a cab from guwahati, get down at mandir, buy a basket with basic things IF YOU WISH.\\nEntry- There are to options to enter, free and paid.\\nFree option will take your whole day so avoid that.\\nVIP/Paid option- The slot of paid option opens every 1-2 hours, but trust me its much better than free option. \\u20b9500 is the fees they charge per head.\\n\\nCaution-This place is famous for tantriks (dark magic) so avoid meeting pandits or babas and just stick to basics of taking basket, going to MAIN mandir, stand in line for couple of minutes and get darshan done.\",\"One of the Maha Shakti peetham, with heat full you pray MAA KAMAKHYA Goddess shall fulfill your desires, visiting this temple it takes 2 to 3 hours and depend on the pilgrims, 500 Indian currency ticket and free darshan besides Armed forces personnel tickets are there, just 10 Kms away from Guwhati airport.\",\"Located in a small hill, this temple has great religious and historic importance. Easily accessible via roads, one can either drive to the temple or take a bus or shared rickshaw from the foothill, right up to the temple. Walking is also an option but the distance is almost 2.5-3km one way, if you don't mind that, you could always walk. I took the bus up and walked back down. The roads are usually not very crowded and are a good walk down, as you can enjoy a nice view of the valley from various view points that are located on the way. The temple may be very crowded on most days though and you may have to wait in a queue to get into the main shrine\",\"Visited kamkhya temple yesterday evening,took vip passes as time constraints were there,could do the darshan in 1 hour,had a pleasant time there.must visit for persons visiting Guwahati for the first time & interested in religious sightseeing.\",\"I was a newbie from south India to Assam . As i heard from one of my friends that kamakhya temple is very famous and holy temple which is one of the most different from spiritual point of view as the goddess kamakhya mandir belongs to the famous shaktipeetas according to the religious belief.\\nWe reached the ASTC bus stop around 9 am\\nThen took a private minibus to kamakhya temple which charge each of us 50rs.\\nThey dropped us near the road side entrance of kamakhya temple which took approximately 20 mins.\\nAs the mandir is located upside hill the transport is either by walk or share cabs auto rickshaws and private and govt buses . we took govt buses which charged around 5 rs it was around 3km with some good views in sides of hilltop houses and lushful greenery the road is bit narrow and has lot of curves\\nthe kamakhya temple is very crowded place as we approached the temple there were around 1000+ people waiting in line to visit the god .\\nif u want to cut down this waiting the temple as coupon of 500 Rs which allows 40 people in one shot very near to the garbhagraha .\\nthe temple has bali peeta in its way were usual offerings like goat buffalo are cut down and taken by the family as per there comfort. The vegans may not find it very pleasing as it had blood stains mixed with water flowing every time a sacrifice is done\\nthe temple also has alot of worshippers who buy pigeons and live it inside temple premises\\nwe skipped the line and watched the matha from bit outside has we didnot have enough time\\nThen on the way back we had breakfast which costed around 70rs for each person\\nwe again took government and the buses and cabs here goes on first in first out bass and until the complete vehicle gets filled you have to wait but as the number of buses and cabs are very frequent you can easily go to the foot of hill.\\nOver all it was good time to be with people of different ages wearing red dresses scarfs kumkum all around us which much more devotion then what i expected to be in temples.\",\"Its a good old architecturally different very famous temple atop the highest point in guwahati. One has to get down at Kamakhya station/Guwahati station (both almost equidistant) and hire a bus/taxi/own vehicle to reach this temple. Two three things to keep in mind is as follows:\\n1) Plan early morning visit (5-5:30 am). Then one can finish the visit by 8am. (temple opens at 7am but queue starts from 4-4:30am). So no matter how early you come, you will get to see few people always in line before you.\\n2) If you have less time, ask for the ticket counter of Rs. 501/- and wait in different line (much much shorter): will finish darshan in 1 hour max.\\n3) Pandas don't force you for money (but still they ask for it) inside the main temple.\\n\\nTemple premise is good and clean (but once you enter, you have to rush towards the queue).\\n\\nTemple grabhgriha is dark and one need to go in and touch the water pit inside and then donate and come(as per wish).\\n\\nGovernment bus ply between kamakhya temple and city (cheapest mode).\",\"I visited temple during my visit it was a sunday afternoon as i went from airport to hotel got freshed and rushed to temple as the sunset is very early in guwahati ! i will recommened visiting the temple in morning or afternon as it gets dark after 4.30pm.\\n\\nWorth visiting its one of the shakti peeths.\",\"As per the 51 satipith on earth the \\\"Kamakhya temple\\\" on \\\"Nil Parbat\\\" is the top in order.As per the history this pith is the (Gupta Anga) of Sati Maa and is highly active for tantra rituals.During the time of Ambabuchi the mother earth has three days mensturation period and by rituals from ancient time the temple is also closed for this days as it is the pith (Gupta anga) of \\\"Sati Maa\\\" also under the period. However history is one thing and faith is another thing which flowing from generation to generation and the man has become more faithful to \\\"Saati Maa\\\" and pray for their wellness and wealth.Apart from that there are many myths around this \\\"Temple\\\", Its structure and other mandirs in complex make it a must see place in Assam. In the month of June during \\\"Ambubuchi\\\" a big curnival is observing from ancient time where deities are offering prayer to the \\\"Sati Maa\\\".It is the annual festival of temple and lacs of people gathering from all the states to participate for this auspicious day to observe the internal power of pith.The doors are remain close for this days. This pith has a powerful attraction among hindus from very ancient time and the patronage of this pith was the \\\"Maharajas Of Coochbehar\\\".The \\\"Bali\\\" was a must ritual part of this \\\"PIth\\\" as the deities keep \\\"Mannat\\\" to \\\"Maa\\\" is giving \\\"Bali\\\" to pith from very ancient time.Now the Bali is stopped.

Also free darshan is available. don't plan to visit on weekends as more rush is there. Management is not proper and corruption is high as no watch dog is there. But darshan will be completed in max 5-6 hrs. in weekends and 2-4 hrs. in week days. Must visit and take blessing from maa kamakhya if visiting guwahati.\",\"One of the important place of worship in the eastern part of India. This temple attracts devotees from different parts of the country . One may walk from the foot hill to top via 'mekhela ujuwa'(a road which was constructed in ancient times to reach this temple). One may wash legs and hands or bath if possible at Saubhagya Kunda before entering the temple. Temple is open from sunrise to sunset and the best time is off course morning .

It is a good place to visit.\",\"We visited the temple in the afternoon which is open from 3 pm to 6 pm. The visit is very systematic and well controlled by the authorities. You need to keep 2 to 3 hours for the visit.\",\"Hotel was overall Good. But be sure what you actually want and what you will get. Otherwise you will be in Trouble.\",\"I wanted to see this temple as I have heard it is one of the Shakti-Peeths. Yes indeed it does seem like some sort of power/spirit it residing inside. It is hard to believe such things but I am sure there must be some scientific explanation to it as well. Your head starts to become heavy and you start feeling tired suddenly when you go inside the temple. The experiences with people vary but something you will definitely fee. When you enter inside the actual temple it is very damp in there and the smoke from the havans and agarbatti's are all around. The temple has rocky base and hard rocky steps with lot of crowd in it. Despite following the queue you will end up colliding and brushing against each other at the real spot.\\n\\nBeware of the priests of the temple. They are like give money here and the Goddess will shower wealth on you. Inside the same temple at different places there are different priests and each one of them demands their own set of share. Its totally your choice on how much you want to spend inside the temple and where you want to do so. The priests are very greedy, till the time you are not giving they say give whatever you wish but as soon as you give something they start asking more. For eg. if you give Rs 51, they say, \\\"arre beta give Rs 501 and Devi Maa will give you more!\\\" I was really amazed to see this kind of attitude inside the temple. So I advise you all should be careful.\\n\\nPlease check the timings of the temple for visitors before you go as they keep on changing with season to season. If you go so far and do not make it, then it really feels sad.\",\"It is one of the main Shakti peeth , I visited there but because of greedy nature of Pujaris I got distracted from my prayer..... So Beware of Brokers & Pujaris...... You don't need any one of them just stand in queue & wait for your turn and don't listen to them\",\"I am from Nepal and we often link Pashupatinath and Kamakshya Dham as a single pilgrimage route. Watching so many people standing on queue made me realize the importance of this place. After a wait for almost 3 hours we could finally enter into the sanctum and we could touch the water, that was very touching and powerful but unfortunately we could not be allowed to stay there for more than a minute.\\n\\nThe place is situated in a hill top called (NILACHAL) and the view from top is amazing. You can see Guwahati city and sometimes trains would pass by and they would look like tiny toy trains.\",\"A rather clean place as compared to other temples I have been to....they said the crowd would be less...we had to wait in queue for about 4 hours. Would have loved to spend some idle time in the premises , but could not due to tight schedules.\\n\\nTo note :\\nThere are 3 lines or queues, the free general lone the separate line for the defence personnel and the third for VIP. The last two categories require passes, which one has to buy.\",\"You have to stand in the queue for 4-5 hours until you are not taking VIP pass of INR 300-500. On Saturday, it is more crowded because Maa Kali is worshipped on saturday.\",\"One of the four Shakti peeth. A must visit and the most important visit for Guwahati if you are a Hindu devotee. Keep something in mind..\\n1. There are three lines in Kamakhya , a general line which extends long and you have to stand in line for a long long time .. and if you wish to visit in this line. Line up ASAP. Second is the VIP line costing 500 rs per head. Line is short and takes atleast 2 hrs less. Third is the defence personnel or VVIP people.\\n2. The temple has animal sacrifice so if you get upset seeing animal sacrifice stay away.\\n3. Take your time don't rush ..The main temple is inside not visible from the little window which is easily accessible.\\nI had a good visit with Lot of blessings.\",\"I had visited during late October month. Too crowded even in special entry counters and the priests are like hawkers coming to devotees for conducting poojas!\",\"The special entry is a bit costly and using general line it will take hours to get entry to the main temple.\",\"Pls do not stand in general line for Puja. Go for 101 Rs or 501Rs Line. Or othrwise you would spend the whole day standing there only.\",\"VIP pass, Special pass , Defense pass and general all becomes one after you enter the real temple. Like that idea.\",\"Its quite important temple in Nilachal Hills, it remains quite crowded so had to go early at 4 yet we had to wait for long hours.\",\"Had heard a lot about this temple and to tell you my experience, I wasn't disappointed. Took a auto from my hotel to this place and it costs 400 to and fro. It was a Saturday and hence the place was relatively crowded. However, temple has provisions that allows you to pay either 501 or 101 and cut the queue short, as is prevalent in many big temples across India. I took the 501 route as I had to rush to a conference. The experience was smooth and I was done with all within an hour.\\n\\nThe temple is a different experience as is the drive up the hill towards the temple. Those who are inclined towards spirituality would find this place worth the visit.\",\"Generally I am quite hesitant to go to any of the long queue temple. This was well managed and we peacefully entered the main shrine in line and came out. Since we took help of one local, the priest also did not haggle on money. Hence for me, the experience was good. Another good point was that they allow you to stay inside main shrine for a couple of minutes and do not push you out unlike some other temples\",\"Nice view of Guwahati city from top of Kamakhya hill. Very long queue of devotees waiting from the early morning. A special pass worth rupees 500 available for special entry. If you get the special entry pass you have to spend 2 to 3 hours in the queue otherwise for entry God knows.\",\"The temple is situated at hills. Very traditional and old temple made of stones. The main \\\"Garbhgruh\\\" is very small. They allow in small lots. One has to be very patient in the queue.There are options of normal queue and paid queue. If you go early in the morning, not need to pay. Free queue won't be too long. Do see the view around the temple.\\nCars are not allowed till the door of temple. One has to walk a little.\",\"Buy a guide to understand the history of the temple. Because of its religious importance, there are queues most of the times any day.\\n\\nPermissions for senior citizens and handicaps to skip the lines. 501 Rs VIP passes (i visited Feb 2020) for those who do not want to opt for queues, but these lines also take 1.5-2 hrs.\",\"Don't miss this very sacred temple. We didn't go inside as the queues were at least 5 hours long as Pilgrims start queueing at daybreak, but just to walk around and soak up the atmosphere was a very moving experience.\",\"There are many temples in the area the best atmosphere is at some of the smaller temples. It is worth walking up the road to the top of the hill both for views and the temples on the way. There is a huge queue for the main temple statue it takes 2.5 hours on average -- you can pay 500 rupees to cut the time down to about 1 hour.\",\"We did not spend a long time there which was good. A swift visit was OK.\\nWould not have been too disappointed to miss it out of the tour.\",\"We had been there at around 9 am and reached back at around 12 pm. To sum it up,we got a VIP pass, waited for around 45 mins in a room. The management of queue was good. As soon as our number came we got entry in another 2 hours. I would suggest to visit the place only if you are strong believer or a devotee. Otherwise this temple could be avoided. Another problem, is that the temple still continues its ritual of bali with pigeons, goats etc. Fortunately, i did not go to that part of temple.\",\"Cant be absolutely sure, but there was something different about the place, be it the architecture  or the devotion of the lakhs of visiting pilgrims or the legend of being the power source of Godess Shakti. We got the VIP tickets for 500 bucks but it still took us couple of hours of finish the visit.\",\"It's a temple for the believers. If you have faith u must visit. Otherwise its not a touristy place. VIP pass for 500 bucks. That also has huge line. Normal entry line not worth mentioning. Make sure you have enough time in hand when coming here\",\"Out of all the Shakti Piths/Shrines, that I've visited, this has to be the best. Ofcourse as per mythology it's one of most powerful shrines, but I also found it most beautiful due to its location in one of the seven sisters.\\n\\nSurrounded by hills all around the view is amazing, and cant get better. The temple is clean and structured.\\n\\nThere are several ways how you can reach the main temple dome, which may involves paying monetary compensation as well:\\n\\n1. There is a free line, which tends to be huge and you need to have atleast 3-4 hrs minimum if you want to go this way.\\n2. Paid line entrants have it slightly easier and shall make it to the main dome earlier.\\n\\nInside the main temple dome, as usual you shall find several priests asking for money here and there, so be prepared for that.\\n\\nHave a great journey.\",\"I didn't actually go in. I didn't want to stand in line for 1.5 hours and I didn't want to pay 500 rupees to fast track my way in. I went around the temple, saw atavistic figures and lots of vermilion streaked pigeons and goats. And then I went my own way.\",\"It is very popular with locals and there is a long queue for darshan. The entire path is lined with many small shops and u can find good bargains here.\",\"I went to the temple although I was lucky not to get any waiting lines etc, but was not able to understand anything as there was no information kiosk or signages about anything at all in the premises of the shrine.\\n\\nI would advice one to research about the same before visting so that you are able to appreciate the site\",\"The place is located at the top of a small hill. The drive to the top of the hill is amazing. If you want to use public transport, you should be able to get direct buses from the Railway station to the temple. Otherwise, there's regular transport available at the bottom of the hill which take you to the top.\\n\\nThe entire place is squeaky clean.\\n\\nThere are separate queues based on the amount you pay and the length of queue is inversely proportional to the amount you pay.\",\"...Yeah that's what you're in for...despite the Rs.501/- ticket you bought! The queues can run long and if they do ..I am sorry ..but, you put yourself there :) May be the sanctum sanctorum will alleviate your pain...just may be! But, if you are a competitive pilgrim...good luck!\",\"This temple is one of the popular in India. There are no misbehavior from the temple's working peoples. I have to wait almost 4 hours to get inside the hotel. VIP pass available on counter.\",\"This temple is situated on a hill. The temple is well maintained and disciplined. Temple is neat and clean also. People have to stand and sometime sitting down a lot in queue for more than 5 hours at least. If people buy the ticket by paying Rs. 501/-, it will take less time.\",\"There are already multiple reviews available so I'll just add some important points per me,\\n1. Go as early as possible in the morning (before 4) be prepared to stand in the queue for several hours. OR you can opt to pay 501 and be little lazy to start your day at 6:30.\\n2. Along with main temple, visit 7 other temples nearby, which are also of powerful tantrik goddesses namely Bagalamukhi ma, Bhuvaneshwari ma, bhairavi ma, dhumavati ma, chhinnamasta ma, Tara ma and Kali ma. All are mapped on Google so you can find them easily.\",\"The place gets crowded, no proper security or arrangements to look after lines going smoothly. Even after paying the short way fees we couldnt get inside because of ill maintainence.\",\"The drive to the top of the hill.. the pictorial view point half way through are enjoyable.\\n\\nOnce out of the vehicle, lots of disturbing \\\"priestmen\\\" who are at your money....\\n\\nthe cleanliness is far from desirable... and to avoid que (but only to wait for one hour) we paid Rs. 501/= with not even a pinch of prasada in return...\\n\\nspiritually this place is considered sacred..so go there only to pray...and close your eyes...\",\"You have to pay Rs 500 for VIP queue and worst part is there was no other queue like general etc. You need to stand in queue from midnight if you wand to touch the idol stone.\",\"Good religious place, avoid public transports like bus due to pick-pockets.choose taxi if going to the temple.\",\"Must visit once in a life time. Feel spiritual.  Start early in the morning to enter easily or come in the evening. There is not much queue in the evening.\",\"I recommend visiting the temple early morning. Reach the entry gate at hill bottom and board the Maruti Van which takes around 7-8 people at a time to hill top. From there you can walk for 5 mins to reach Temple enterance. There are 3 lines to enter main temple building. General line where people stand in queue from 4am, Rs 100/person line and Rs 500/person line. All line people get entry at 8am only. Scenic beauty and sacred feeling. Its divine experience.\",\"Visited the temple late in the evening, during the Navratri week. Beautiful night time lighting and floral decorations on all the towers made it an awesome sight. The main deity access was closed, but the courtyard was buzzing with people. A walk up from the car park takes about 10 min. There are manned shelves to put away your shoes (Rs 5 per pair) before entry. Walking around the temple courtyard will take about 15 min. No charges for entering the temple compound.\",\"Inside of the temple is kept relatively clean. What a scene inside though. If you pay enough money you can go to see the statue rapidly through a separate gate. If you pay a bit less, a bit longer line and if you pay really less, you will wait for hours inside two locked up cages. Yes, CAGES. Yes, LOCKED UP. Disgusting. No, we did not care to see the statue.\",\"Temple is easily approachable with Uber or Ola, temple general que is quite crowded hence if you want to skip the same take Special Pass/ VIP ticket which costs 501 Rs and free for children aged less than 10 years. Carry your own water bottles as there won't be vendors selling the same. You can place the shoes and luggage for free near the Anna Prasad counter. Note that special que / VIP que doesn't operate between 12pm -3pm.\\n\\nOver all excellent divine power experience to the ones who visit here.\",\"really smelly and dirty inside. Also, they charge quite a bit - special line was a quick way but cost 5 times the amount. Otherwise you have to suffer in a long queue, in case it is a busy day. Over that the regular priests want to capture your time, perhaps to make money on you. What is nice is the view from the place. It is on top of a hill; one of the high points of the city so if you go that far also check out the viewing areas available.\",\"The temple has some very powerful effect.. It can be felt if you just sit down and meditate in the temple premises...\\nHuge long lines, but very well maintained temple.\\nWould love to go there again and again.\\nPasses are available for 501, 101.. incase you do not want to spend 3 - 4 hours in a line for darshan.\\nDo visit if you go to Guwahati.\",\"The temple is a must visit for the beleivers. They have a Rs 500 pass for quick access but on a crowded day this too can take 3 hours. The ques are well managed and orderly. Better to take a local priest to show you through the rituals as that saves time.\",\"Expect to stand in line even after buying the Rs 501 pass. One should check online if the pass is available.\",\"It is a beautiful temple although the crowd pouring has increased tremendously so the current management needs to figure out a way to manage the litter, the crowd and the queue system.\\n\\nWe took the Rs 500 ticket that promised less wait but realized it was a bad day and we had to still wait 2 hours! We also realized that the economy has evolved and everyone can now afford the Rs 500, so may be now for the Rs 1000 or the VIP line! It would get pretty hot and messy in summers!!\\n\\nThere is a line for everything here including the 12 noon free prasad lunch that goes all the way down to the stairs on the hill! We had to skip it.\",\"One of the most auspicious temple in India.\\n\\nIt's advisisable to start your day very early..say around 6-6:30 am.\\n\\nThere will be huge rush on a good day.\\n\\nVIP passes are available but for limited time only. One thing to be kept in mind is that VIP pass helps you skip the que to a certain point and after that point it will merge with general que.\\n\\nMy advice : keep at least 4-6 hours reserved for the temple visit.\",\"From the point of view of a normal person, a good place for a time pass. I was insisted to visit this place with my friends, roaming around at the temple premises when others were worshiping. Nice to have a stroll, to look around ponds, the wooden frames for sacrificing animals, and watching others to praying with strong belief.\\n\\nThe two things I would like to mention: First is the special queue. One needs to spend 500 bucks per person to stand on the smaller queue. Which is expensive when you visit with your whole family and children. Second is the presence of monkeys. They tend to rob any food item from your hands. be aware of them.\",\"I visited in the first week of Feb,2016.It was around 9 am morning , rush of pilgrims was  average but temple authority was not actively managing the crowd.There is one VIP line for which people are charged.There is tradition of killing of  male goats still prevalent in the temple premises.\",\"Very much enjoyed visiting this temple which is one of the most important Shakti Peeth temples in India. It is a rather long queue to enter but you can pay extra for shorter VIP queue. There are a few other smaller temples on the site including one dedicated to Maa Tara.\",\"Everyone got be here once is all I can say. Amazing temple dedicated to Goddess Sati. Its main temple is surrounded by many small temples. Temple is located at height on hill which is well connected by road. Its is better to start early as the line is huge. Even if you are taking VIP entry pass one should reach here by 7.30 AM and still it will take 2 hours to finish the darshan of Goddess. General line starts from very early morning say 5 o' clock on normal days, and it might take entire day to get into GARBHAGRIHAq through this line. VIP entry pass costs 500 rupees. One can leave their footwears just outside the temple at shops which sells offerings. So drop your shoes near the gate of temple only. No shop charges any money for keeping the shoes etc. Only thing is buy some items from the shop.\",\"Must visit Temple. Better to go early morning as it can become very crowded. Main problem is that the queue moves very slowly as the main shrine is below in a cave and devotees are let in a single file and come out in a single line slowly.\",\"Since I went there on a Sunday. The place had a very long queue, although they do have paid queue which is shorter and costs 501INR.\\nThey have a defence entry as well.\",\"Enjoyed our short visit. We didn't stand in the queue for hours to see the inside. Enjoyed our outside view. Many stairs to climb.\",\"It is strange what reading negative reviews can do to a traveler. After reading some of the negative reviews on TripAdvisor, I was scared going to the temple with 5-yr old, fearing unclean premises and \\\"live\\\" sacrifices.\\nBut when \\\"maa\\\" calls you, you have to respond and thankfully we did.\\n\\nThe temple premises are clean (unlike what some reviewers wrote) and the energy inside the temple is unbelievable. My kid had no problems at all. However, we did skip the queue by buying the 500 Rs ticket.\\n\\nUber is readily available in Guwahati and you will get one easily to take you to the temple. The views from the top are amazing. Do stop by to click pics.\\n\\nYou can wear your shoes all the way to the top. No need to remove them early on. You can also safely ignore the shopkeepers on the way. They don't heckle you but you shouldn't grudge them the selling pitch. Same for the priests. They let you be once you've politely declined their service.\",\"It took around 4 hrs to complete the puja starting the time we have been part of the queue for the first time...line management is good...almost 80% of the time from where queue moves has sitting arrangements..all these are description of general line without any entry fee to the line...\\n\\nThere is a line (paid line 501/head )start from the place where 80% of general queue ends...i was there on a Sunday and the time (11:30 am) when we reached there..the 501 ticket was temporarily closed and supposed to re-open at 3 pm...so we became part of general line and finished the complete activity by 3:45 pm..\",\"Nce motorable road. Cant enter as the inside is clostrofobic. had to worship from 1st gate. long que cud be avoided paying higher entry fees.\",\"If your intention is to visit temple you need to dedicate a full day. If you want to see deity, you have to stand it queue for 6-8 hours with normal ticket or 4-6 hours with rs.500 ticket. construction of the temple is marvelous.not advisable for standing in queue with kids or old age people as you may feel suffocating inside the temple, if you stand for long time. If you are a tourist, you can stop by the temple and enjoy the beauty of the rock structures.\",\"This is quite a famous temple and was very crowded when we visited. Entry into the inner sanctum will take anywhere between 2-3 hours (depending on the ticket type). Overall, it is worth a visit but if you wish to enter the inner areas, then plan for 2-3 hours of time at the minimum\",\"A very nice temple with divinity pouring in from the deity in the form of vibrations felt by me and before i could decide whether it was true or imaginary, the same divine vibratory effect has been felt by another devotee from Hyderabad who seemed to be highly educated standing next to me and one may have to experience the same by visiting the temple to believe it to be true.Crowd management can be done in a better way and have 1 or 2 entrances instead of multiple queues and the crowd be given atleast a couple of minutes to sit peacefully and pray.\",\"There is a VIP line and a regular line, needless to say VIP is much faster moving. The temple has an aura about it. The shops outside sell souvenirs as well as religious items.\",\"The location of the temple is very beautiful. Although the waiting queue sometimes stretches to a great length, but the wait is worth the visit.\",\"One of the most important Shakti Peeths and a very powerful place. One can purchase a ticket to cut the very long waiting line.\",\"Unique temple for HIndu believers!  Located on top of a small hill.  Wating time could be about 90-120 mintues on most days. Quite crowded. Actual dharsahn time very short.\",\"I have traveled to this place on Aug 2014.Location is ok.You can avail share auto or taxi to reach that place but you need to bargain a lot for the same.Have to stand a long queue to get a darsan if you are standing in a general line which is free.It suitable for the local people as it takes 3-4 hrs.Three  other lines are there as well 50/101 and 501.501 rs line will take 30 min approx.\",\"the complex is quaint and nice.\\nit is a 4 km walk up from the main road and a small eatery on the way served among the best tea i had in a long time.\\n\\nthe temple rules are funny,\\nthey issued a 501 rupee ticket at 10... and we had to wait till 1.30 for the main deity doors to open..\\nvery funny... no one seems to know when the main doors will open..!!\",\"Has a great view of the city and the Brahmaputra. You could plan to climb up on foot or hire a cab. The queue is pretty huge to see the deity but on the outside it is free.\",\"All positives have already been jotted down by people and by now you would have found out the history and stuff.\\nI would like to pin point some things wrt to timings for ease of visit. Entry Types are as follows:\\n1. Defence Person: a complete different line who belong to defence/ paramilitary forces on the left as soon you enter the main gate. Some days the line is short and many a times like Sunday/ Holiday the line is very much big. As this ticket counter is open for an hour or so ( from 7am to 8am roughly) one needs to be in line irrespective of his/her rank/ dependency. The temple auth are very strict for the counter timings so if ur left out ur LEFT out to opt for next options only.\\n\\n2. Special Entry \\u20b9 500/- Iine: this too has many people standing and one needs to weigh if they can stand in the line for over an hour or so.\\n\\n3. Devotees Line: this one is one where your Patience will come to play.\\n\\n4. Misc : VIP jugaad!! ?? : let me tell you even if u take this option u need to get in the same defence / \\u20b9 500 wala line with a small lead so risk it yourself.\\n\\n8:00 AM - Temple door open for devotees\\n1:00 PM - Temple door closed for cooked offerings\\n2:30 PM - Temple door reopens for the devotees\\n5:15 PM - Closing of the temple door for the night\",\"Good religious place, the only challenge is in terms of time required to visit the temple unless arranged for VIP entry the same takes around 4-5 hours time.\",\"Reaching the Temple: I was staying in hotel near airport. It took more than an hour to book a uber or ola, because after accepting the trip, drivers cancelled trip. Local taxi were quoting very high (When landed in GAU Airport, even the pre-paid taxi counter charged 300 INR for just a 1km ride. Since we had luggage and kid, we had to budge to the pressure). It took 45min to reach temple\\n\\nTemple and it's surrounding:\\nToo much crowded, no proper traffic management, honking and rash driving all over. Each shop guys would call out loud and lure you to buy offerings for the temple. I saw most of them with greedy eyes and even had distasteful look at ladies. Very uncomfortable ambience.\\nThough there is lot of emphasis on cleanliness and swach campaigns, the whole place, road towards temple, inside the temple premises, toilets were all foul smelling and dirty.\\n\\nInside temple:\\nIf you don't book tickets in the morning, you have to go through a long que and wait for hours before you get darshan of deity. To take advantage of this crowded situation, there are greedy pandits who flock around you offering to show you deity, get you holy water, do pooja etc. They take you to one of the mandaps, ask for money, do some rituals for the sake of doing, and will rush you through before exiting.\\n\\nMy views:\\nTemples are sacred locations where each of the devotee should take extra care to maintain cleanliness, calm and serene atmosphere. I felt, in the name of devotion the temple turned into a market place filled with greed and treachery. It was painful to see the state of affairs. I pray to the Kamakhya Devi to remove the ignorance and greed in people and authorities to plan, and maintain order\\n\\nGuwahati was also not very conducive place to visit. Overall a bad experience to forget\\n\\nReturn:\\nAnother painstaking effort to find cab, all greedy taxi drivers waiting to extract money out of you. A very rash driver in maruti omni agreed for 450 INR to drop to hotel near airport\",\"This temple is considered Shakti Peeth and hence is crowded all time. We were able to go as we were told there is queue and expected waiting time is 8 hours. There is also a VIP entry with a charge of Rs 500 per person. I am totally against this commercialization in temples , hence we did not go.\",\"Its an important Shakti Peeth for Hindus, however the temple premises can be better maintained in terms of cleanliness & hygiene. Makes sense only if you buy vip tickets of Rs. 500/- each else may take 3-4 hours for getting into the sanctum sanctorum.\",\"the place as everybody knows is a holy place, but complaint is the queue formation in order to offer your offerings, it is inside a cage like structure with no exit in between, so if you want to visit the washroom you are stuck in between a long narrow queue\",\"I really loved the journey to the temple and was excited as had heard so much about it. But when we reached it was really crowded and there was a long waiting line of almost many hours before you could enter the main shrine. We just sat there for a while and came back as didn't want to stand in long queue.\",\"The overall experience of going in and getting the Dharsan was good.  Getting there was not a problem and no hassle inside the temple for different services.  We get what we wanted and had a good dharsan.\",\"A bit far out of town, we went there by taxi, don't know if we would have found it taking a bus. The temple is situated in a giant complex on top of the hill. It takes a while until you reach the main part. Of course you have to take your shoes off at some point.\\n\\nWe went too late to queue in, and I thought we better leave the visit to the inner sanctum to the Shakti devotees. So we just watched what's going on from the outside. It was an exciting and fascinating experience, would not want to have missed it.\",\"It's difficult to say anything because if you have the faith, this is among the most significant of all temples in India. The doors of the inner sanctum opens twice a day - 7 to 1 in the morning and 2.30 to 4.30 in the afternoon. Rest of time you can visit the temple and offer prayers from the outside. Fairly well maintained and clean.\",\"Its beauty is jaw dropping and a very famous temple in India.  Remember its on top of a hill and can be accessible by city bus and other vehicles. But please note that  the worship queue is very very long and it could consume your 7 to 8 hrs in ususal days, so plan your trip accordingly. However if u only want to visit the place and bring some prasad than that could b done by awarding 100 rupees to priest standing near by temple which could consume ir 20 to 30 mins.\",\"Surrounded by many shops; lots and lots of people visiting the temple and it usually will take hours to reach in the inner sanctum. Clean environment and only a short climb from the parking lot.\",\"It was my bad luck for which I was unable to see the main shrine of goddess there due to rush in general line as it was Tuesday which is used to be rush on that day which I was not aware of that. Else would have gone for the vip line in which I have to pay 500 per person to get in smaller line to see the main shrine.\",\"Go early here to avoid the queues.Its awesome and view from the top is really good.vip line is costly around 500 per person and general line is long\",\"Would have rated 'good' if that was there such an option\\n\\nA trip to Guwahati is incomplete without a visit to Kamakhya temple. The temple is a quick drive from the main city & is situated on top of a hill. The ride from down hill to uphill is really beautiful. The main dome of the temple is beautiful as are the stone carvings adorning the walls of the dome.\\n\\nWe bought Rs.500/- ticket & stood in the shortest queue. The sanctum is beautiful and though the deity is covered completely in flowers, the place evokes a sense of strong devotion. The line further leads to the inner (main) sanctum which is in a cave-like setting, you need to watch your footing here as it is completely dark and the steps are weak.\\n\\nFew important tips:\\n1.Try and make this an early morning visit so that there queue is shorter\\n2.Wear clothing that is not constricting as in the main sanctum, you will need to lean and reach out to touch the feet of the deity.\\n3.Animal sacrifice takes place at the temple, while you can avoid the sight of the actual act, you cannot miss the animals being led to it.

of a hill, the temple is quite large and has some nice ancient buildings, but moderns cage-like corridors have been added to accommodate the crowds of visitors. Interesting to witness animal sacrifices (people bring pigeons and goats).\",\"The temple and its surrounding temples of the Dasa Mahavidyas are vibrant with spiritual energy.  The only saddening aspect of the atmosphere there is the rows of goats, cows and wicker baskets of pigeons patiently waiting to be sacrificed in the sacrificial hall (on the premises) adjacent to the main temple.   The understanding is that the meat of the sacrificed animals is distributed as prasad to the surrounding poor families residing in the villages.  An alternative prasad of whole grains and rice including vegetables instead can be distributed daily as Devi Kamakhya temples abounds in wealth given by the devout pilgrims.  It is an age old tradition to sacrifice animals but there is no need for this cruelty.  Even they have a life and if we do not have the power to give life except Devi Maata then how can we think we are entitled to take a life?  Devi Maata is pleased even if we offer a simple flower with devotion.  The element of Devotion and Bhakti is important, not whether we are sacrificing an animal to please her.\",\"Kamakhya temple is a shakti pith,situated on Nilanchal hills.\\nWe reached there at 5 a.m in the morning,after 2 hours it was our turn to enter.The architecture of the temple is delightful.\\nWeekends are over crowded,even after entering in main temple you have to wait in a long queue..\\nThe only bad thing is animal sacrifice(goats)performed in temple premises as offering to goddess...\",\"I came here long time back when I was a school going kid. Yet I seem to remember those thousands of pigeons sitting on the dome of the mandir. I am not much of a religious person, but this Mandir is very famous and is related to history in Mahabharata.\",\"As a resident of the area have gone on morning walks up the hill decades ago. Today it is very crowded and the external ambience is commercial. As a place where animal sacrifice is done, have chosen never to go in.\",\"The temple is of immense significance according to Hindu tradition. It can accessed by a ride up the hill but had decent parking facilities. We visited in the afternoon and lucky to have hardly any rush. Sanctum sanctorum was also empty but have heard that there are huge queues in the morning. Its an old temple made completely out of stone. The steps, corridors, verandah etc. are all cut out of stone and hence gives it ancient look. Hence, it is a nice experience.It is also famous for goat sacrifice and we could spot a goat head near the main idol. However, it is not necessary to witness the sacrifice.For religious purposes, one can visit it if in Assam.\",\"Heard a lot about the famous Kamakhya temple; but my experience was not a pleasant one.\\n\\nThe temple complex is huge and there are other temples close to the Kamakhya temple. The temple is mostly crowded. The temple is closed from afternoon 1 pm to 2.30 pm.\\n\\nOnce you go into the temple; you can find many goats and pigeons in and around the temple.\\nThis is a very touching scene...I got to see the priest dragging 3-4 goats which were crying.....This was very scary. Understand that goats and pigeons are sacrificed as an offering to the Godess. I also got to see bleeding pigeons lying around the temple area.\\n\\nWonder why the PETA doesnt take action for such things...perhaps they are scared if it would hurt the religious sentiments of the people.\\nMay be we are not used to seeing such sights.\\n\\nDue to this I was quite upset by the visit to the temple.\",\"This temple has an important past and people from remote parts of country visit here,Overall the temple is situated in large area to handle loads of devotees.The location where it is situated is on a hill so one can get a soothing view from the temple,But something that drew me out of the temple too early was the smell of goats roaming freely in the temple premise,yes we asked people the reason for such large population of goats there and came to know that these are either rescued from different places and set free here,or are used for offering BALI in the temple.Otherwise the temple has an excellent atmosphere.And you will find stuffs made of wood (bamboo) at the shops here\",\"I am not very religious but I still made sure to go to Kamakhya temple after reading the reviews. This has an interesting shape (unlike the south or northern temples). I was initially surprised to see many goats and pigeons inside the temple premise. I also heard about the animal sacrifice during festivals. We visited the in the evening (after sunset) and missed to see the city landscape and the Brahmaputra river from the hill. It was worth the visit.\",\"they sacrifice pigeons and ducks and what not.\\nplease read ancient history of temple on wiki , and then consider going.\",\"It is located on a Hill top and is extremely religious. Lots of goats are sacrificed to appease goddess Durga.\",\"The dark and true face of the 'India Shining' community is bluntly evident over here. Animals and birds are ruthlessly offered in open in the name of God at a shockingly brisk pace. The long and stagnant queues provide a horrific show of these gruesome killings. The visit made me sick from inside and further strengthened my disbelief in the belief to believe in God.\\n\\nVisit at your own risk.\",\"This is the main Shakti Peeth and has a great story behind it. The temple situated on top of a hill is little walk from the parking. Once again I was totally amazed with the cleanliness given the fact that goats and Bulls are sacrificed here. Best time to reach the temple is by 6 am and take the 500 rs VIP pass to enter. If you miss this, then there is a long queue to enter the temple and can take hours. Kids are allowed to enter any time. There is no idol in the time, but Goddess Yoni which secretes Ganga Water which is to be worshipped. The temple is shut 3 days a year when bleeding happens... The priests at the temple are also helpful, though some you should beware of... Overall again a Divine Experience...\",\"This temple is known for animal sacrifices so we were vary of going there but we did attempt. The temple itself is beautiful, well maintained but the smell of blood, pigeon poop and traditional incense makes it a bit difficult to enjoy the temple itself. A quick visit to see the Goddess is a great idea.\",\"this temple is situated at the top of nilachal hill.it is an important pilgrimage destination for Hindus and Tantric worshipers. apart from the main temple there are temples dedicated to different forms of the mother godness such as Ma Kali, Bagala,Tara,Chinnamasta,Bhuvaneswari,Bhairavi,Dhumavati,five temples dedicated to Lord Shiva and three temples to Lord Vishnu.there are other temples of various goddess too\\nTemple timings-8am to 1pm again 2.30 pm onwards.\\nImportant festivals-Ambubachi,Durga puja,Shiva ratri,Manasa puja.\\nWe went there around 3pm.it was not that crowded at that time.we took VIP tickets for Rs500.we completed our darshan within 1hr.animal sacrifice is very common here.\\nIn the morning it is v.crowded .many devotees come here carrying goats with them for sacrificing.pandits are polite.everything done here in a systematic way.\",\"This temple is the main seat of Tantric Hinduism and there are several associated stories and myths. It is said that this is the only temple in India where the 'yoni' is worshipped and the statue of the main deity bleeds every month.\\n\\nI visited on a Sunday and there was an extremely long queue to enter the temple, so did not go inside. Many ritual sacrifices are performed at the back of the main shrine - one can see goats tethered to posts, waiting to be culled.\\n\\nYou can reach Kamakhya Temple by taking a shared vehicle from the base of the hill. There is also a walking path, which is very green and not crowded. It is better served for climbing down though, as the steps and rocks are slippery.\",\"Its a huge temple at Guwahati where there is a lot of animal sacrifice which happens -- Goats, pigeons , etc.\\nWhile the temple itself is beautiful , it sure is a bit terrifying when you see Goats and Birds being given up for sacrifice. Thankfully avoided going to the place where the sacrifices are done.\",\"This temple is really old and holds a mythological importance however please kill animals here as an offering to the goddess. Not many people can bear it. No one takes care of birds as well. I found a dead pigeon there being protected by another pigeon\",\"eat something before you start....looooong queue for darshan. lot of goat sacrifices..not suitable for vegetarians becoz of blood smell due to sacrifices. God bless us all!\",\"After visiting Guwahati, Kamakhya Temple was naturally on the top of the list. We visited on a Sunday morning and hence the crowd was more. The whole place is flooded with pandits who want to do some special pooja for a fee. Everywhere you find them sitting with a few currencies spread before them (indication to you to drop some). Since this is a typical Durga temple, I think there were many goats that were being dragged for sacrificial offering. This didn't go well with our animal loving mindset.\\n\\nOverall, it was more of a tick mark we did our list of places to see, but did feel much holiness or divinity visiting the place. Took a few photos and left.\",\"Just the reason to stay away from religion. Goats, chicken sacrificed before your eyes.  As soon as I got out of the Auto I was hounded by a priest to do a puja.\",\"The place is crowded and long queues as most religious sites in India. Did not enjoy the place much after seeing goats getting dragged to the butcher for sacrifice at the temple. Lets become rational and stop such cruelty to animals. Go vegetarian!\",\"There is a saying about this temple that if you visit it once than maa calls you three times. Its a must visit for anyone who goes to Ghy. Its advisable not to engage any pundas and offer the prayers directly. There is sacrifice that happens there so one should be prepared.\",\"As per Hindu Mythology This is one of the Shakti peeth ,specially known for \\\"Tantra\\\".\\nTemple is situated at Hill of Nilanchal and now temple is approachable via roads upto near mandir.\\nTough to pray in this Temple\\nSimple normal Line and Sp. VIP Rs 501 both have long Queues. Timing is also restricted ,not open in evening so only few Hours ( 8 am to 4 pm ) temple can be visited at Worship garbh grih\\nThis Temple has some restrictions and believes ,heir devotion consisted in burning fires in their hearths , singing hymns to their gods and offering rice , milk , soma or animals as sacrifice.\\nSo only visit if you believe in Hindu God and traditions of animals as sacrific\",\"Trip Summary: Delhi-Guwahati-Shillong-Cherrapunji-mawyalong-Dawki-Shillong-Guwahati-Delhi - 4 days\\n\\nWe went to this place on first day of our trip soon after we landed on airport.\\nThe taxi will drop you to a place where you have to walk for few mts and then enter. Since I come from culture which is non-violent and the whole idea of animals being cut left me shocked..\\n\\nAtleast I would not recommend if you are not into such acts to be seen like goats with varied color and ready to be cut..It wasnt worth for me and we spent few mts.\\n\\nThere can be big queues etc as well\",\"Too much blood is all i can say.

Unfortunately I heard that these animals (mostly goats, sheep and doves) were destined for sacrifice which is something I can't condone and did not want to see anyway, though I understand it's been part of the tradition of the place for many years. Hopefully this facet of the temple will change with time and be found unnecessary as a part of worship but it's something to bear in mind if you visit there...that you may see or hear this going on and may find it disturbing. Beyond that aspect of the place it is a huge and truly beautiful place with carved pillars and areas for lighting candles as well as inner recesses for giving offerings and receiving blessings, though you have to queue for such in organised wire netted corridors.

One can reach the temple on foot (not advisable for elderly, children and unfit persons), by bus or taxi. There is huge queues outside the temple every single day so for hasslefree darshan and puja one should reach early i.e., latest by 7 am. During Ambubachi (3-4 days period in June-July when mother goddess is said to menstruate) the temple is closed and there is a huge mela outside the temple. It is most auspicious to visit the temple immediately after it reopens after Ambubachi. So people from various states come to seek blessings and offer prayers during that period. During this period the queues of devotees can go upto several kilometers. So unless you are a devout devotee avoid going to the temple during this period. Ditto navratri period. Animal sacrifice is still practiced and there is a separate enclosure where the animal (goats, pigeons and even buffaloes) are slaughtered. It is advisable to avoid the said enclosure if you are weak hearted.\",\"Be prepared for the sacrifices you may see, the blood and the equanimity on the faces of the religious could be disturbing.

The temple is on a hill close to the shore of the Brahmaputra river and was built in reverence to the Goddess Sati and the occult is still practiced there. It has  seven oval spires and inside one daily animal, generally goat, sacrifices are made. We were forewarned before we went in so that we could avoid seeing anything we didn't want to.  One goat sacrifice had just taken place and the animal was being skinned and jointed and the meat would be given to the people. As it was Sunday the whole area was very very crowded and very noisy and colourful. One particular temple is where the locals worship to bring fertility to the family and there was a massive queue of four to five hours to go in.\",\"This is one of the very important of 52 Shakti Pithas, the most sacred places of the Divine Mother, for the Hindus.

The sacrifice of goats and buffaloes are still offered in open. The weak in heart should not dare to see this ritual! Some devotees free pigeons in the air as an alternative of the sacrifice. You have to wait in the queue for at least 2 hours any day; hence try to visit the temple in early hours. A special taxi takes Rs 100 to ferry you from the main road upto the temple; the shared taxis only Rs 10. There is a small water pool too where it is mandatory to offer worship to Ganesha. In annakshetra, one can have a free meal prasad too.\\nIt feels great being here.\",\"This Shakti Peeth finds reference in the ancient epic Mahabharat. It is situated on top of a hill around 25 km from airport. One needs a private vehicle/ taxi to reach there. Vehicle takes you right upto the temple. Not much walking or climbing of stairs is involved. Special arrangements on payment, are there for handicapped. We visited in the afternoon. Tookt a VIP ticket for Rs 501/-. It took us about 45 minutes to reach the sanctum. General que was quite long and appeared heldup. Final about 10 meters, the passage is narrow and dimly lit. Few slippery steps take you down to the deity (pindi), in a small pool of water. You are permitted to touch the pindi and sprinkle holy water.

The  temple does not have an idol and has a stone like formation in the Garbha Graha. It has a separate section for conducting sacrifices of animals which could be slightly disturbing to those who are not used to the concept of sacrifices. One of my friends were disturbed seeing the head of goat (that was sacrificed earlier) kept inside the garbha griha.

While this is a place where animal sacrifice is practiced, the area is tucked away deep inside, far from view.  My visit during the afternoon was free from this facet.  All my apprehensions of seeing/ hearing sounds of animals were allayed, and I was overwhelmed by the immense Shakti (power) of the sacred precincts.  A must visit place, with your family and friends.\",\"The Kamakya Temple is- so to say - a bloody temple. A wonderful place to stroll around. On special days it can be very crowded and the people are launched through high gates to the temple's court. On these days there are mass offerings. Visitors bring young goats, pigeon and other animals they love and meant to be offered. This is done by beheading and certainly not for the faint hearted. This ritual was also done with a young male buffelo. The guy beheaded the buffalo with a sword in one swing. All done ritually and the head was carried into the temple. Sounds all brutal, but a tradition which we were very content and proud to be part of.\",\"Kamakhya Temple, herd to be the must visit place in Guwahati.

We some how understood they are going to sacrifice the pigeon in name of god. Then we came through the area were several goats were tied up having sindoor on them again got to know its for d goddess to sacrifice there blood. Finally when we entered the temple I had held my heart tight and almost tears in my eyes when I saw the entire floor red which was the color of the blood of the sacrificed animals and some vessels kept to fill in the blood. The main idol of the goddess was beautiful but drew my attention towards the chopped heads of the buffaloes kept below her feet, were tongues and eyes were popped out with tears in their eyes, I tried clicking picture to circulate among the public and spread awareness on animal cruelty in name of god BUT its strictly prohibited there and few pundits had eye on us.\\n\\nI would not recommend this temple to anyone, as it still follows the old ritual of animal sacrifice which makes non sense in my eyes, my entire day turned to be shocking experience and never forgetting moment.\\n\\nI would want this message to be reached and some action to be taken against such activities, I know its so popular that none would consider it relevant , but this is the FACT.

Goats, monkeys and pigeons were present in the courtyard; but mercifully there were no signs of animal sacrifice which I believe is a common practice here. I did not enter the temple itself as there was a long queue and privileged access required a payment of Rs. 501 - an amount I would rather spend on a good book. My friend who did shell out that sum and entered the temple, seemed crestfallen on her return as the Yoni (representing the goddess) in the sanctum was mostly covered up. I enjoyed going around the courtyard looking at sundry shrines and idols. Also saw stunning panoramic views of the surrounding landscape from a location just beyond the (avoidable) toilet block.

The drive to the temple is beautiful, winding up the hill.\",\"Its a great experience vising Kamakhya Temple which is one of the most sacred of the 51 Shaktipeeths. The sad part of our ancient temples is that there is no one to explain or guide the visitors about the history or even facts of the holy structures. One visits and does not know the importance of the different sites within the temple. The same is the case with Kamakhya Temple. There are carvings of variious Gods on the pillars and on the inside walls of the main temple and the inner sanctum is located below ground level and is always kept in darkness. it is told that lot of Tantric activities including sacrifices and black magic are practiced in this temple. Its a must visit for all pilgrims.\",\"Kamakhya is a great temple town, don't miss it!  The temple inner sanctum is so lovely.

Take time to venture beyond the temple gates as the Bhairabi Temple down the stairs is worth the visit.We stayed at a guest house right next to Kamakhya Temple that was hidden behind an old door.

The family has been keepers of the Kamakhya Temple for over 400 years.  We lived in the family compound and were allowed a visit to the temple.  Everyone we met was kind and thoughtful to us - everyone from the family to the priest to the shop keepers i in fact, when we left, one of the shop keepers came running to the taxi stand to give us hugs goodbye.  It was a treasured time of harmony, fun, ceremonies, graciousness and generosity.  We were dressed appropriately when we visited the temple and went with a very close friend of the family who was a priest.  We were carefully guided throughout the temple, its museum and its grounds, and, afterwards the people of Kamakhya were aware of how careful we had been to observe their traditions which made our stay there so fulfilling and compassionate.  The temple itself is magnificent.  Its bells in clusters.  Its sculptures covered in scarlet.  Its goats and geese and monkeys create a vibrant atmosphere of life and sacrifice.  It's a remarkable place for an inward journey.\",\"I was lucky to get through to the top. The view was great. More than that, I was astonished to find many more temples around.

Its immense historical and religious importance makes it a must visit temple.\",\"The moment I thought of Kamakhya I thought it is a temple dedicated to Mother Goddess Parvathi in the name of Kamakhya. When I landed at the Kamakhya temple at Guwahati, I wanted to know the stala purana, means the story of the place. This is what I do first wherever I go. I have read the mythological story of Daksha son of Lord Brahma. Daksha had 28 daughters. His first daughter Sathi fell in love with Lord Shiva and went away with Him to Kailasa, against the wishes of her father. Planet Chandra (Moon) married all the other 27 daughters of Daksha. Being pleased with the obedience of 27 daughters Daksha blessed them to be the permanent stars glittering always on the sky. That is how there are 27 stars in Hindu astrology. On the advice of father Brahma, Daksha under took to perform Yagna for the good of the universe. He invited all the gods, except Shiva and Sathi, to attend the function. Sathi wanted to attend the function though not invited. She pestered her husband Shiva to permit her to attend the function. Without waiting for his nod she went away to her parents\\u2019 home. Daksha not only scolded Sathi but also insulted Shiva using low language. Enraged with utter disappointment and unbearable insult she jumped into the sacrificing fire and committed suicide. Up to this point the story, as I know, is OK.\\n\\nThe astonishing feature of the story as well as the cause for the Kamakhya is this: On the death of Sathi, Shiva sends Virabhadra and Kali along with all Shivaganas to kill Daksha and they did so. Lord Vishnu cuts off the dead body of Sathi from His disk into 108 pieces and scattered them over the earth. All those 108 places wherever the pieces fell are considered as Shakthi Peetas in India. Among them 51 are more powerful again among those 51, Kamakhya is more dominant power-driven place. It is, according to the story, because the \\u2018Yoni\\u2019 of Sathi had fallen in this place. But what is this Yoni. \\u2018Yoni\\u2019 means vagina/vulva. That is where I was shocked to know the story of the place.\\n\\nThe main deity in Kamakhya Temple is mother goddess Kamakhya. It is said to be one of the oldest of the 51 Pitas Situated on the Nilachal Hill in western part of Guwahati city in Assam, India. This temple houses other ten individual shrines called Mahavidyas within its compound. They are Bhuvaneshvari, Bagalamukhi, Chinnamasta, Tripura Sundari, Thara, Kali, Bhairavi, Dhumavati, Matangi and Kamala.\\n\\nThe temple is said to be of 8th century and moderated by the rulers from time to time and the present one is of 17th century. It is titled as\\u2019 in the Nilachal type\\u2019. This temple is in hemispherical dome on a cruciform base. There are four chambers namely garbhagriha and three mandapas, which are called by local name as Calanta, Pancaratna and Natamandira aligned from east to west.\\n\\nThe main deity is not like an idol as we see generally in all Hindu temples. The Garbhagriha is the sanctum sanctorum of the temple. It is below ground level. There is no icon but a rock is found split in the shape of a yoni. It is tiny, dark space that can be reached by narrow steep stone steps. There I saw a sheet of stone sloping down from both sides and leads to the spot of yoni-like shaped portion of about 10 inches deep. The yoni portion is the sacred and holy symbol of Mother Kamakhya. This yoni is always filled with water as there is an underground permanent spring. This yoni, that is the vulva-shaped spot, is worshiped as the Mother Goddess Kamakhya. It is familiarly known as the most important pitha (abode) of the Goddess.\\n\\nHere, as I saw, two types of worshippers of the goddess. One is Vamachara (Left-Hand Path) and the second is Dakshinachara (Right-Hand Path). Those who want to acquire Tantric vidya they worship in Vamachara (Left-Hand Path) method whereas the others worship in Dakshinachara (Right-Hand Path) system. The apparent difference is the former offer Bali, means sacrificing sheep, goat etc whom I say non-veg devotees and the latter offer only sweets to the goddess, I call them vegetarian devotees. The wonderful speciality is female animals are exempt from sacrifice, probably because the goddess is female. Though these sacrificing animals can be sympathised as \\u201cpoor animals\\u201d yet the females are lucky.\\n\\nThe Tantric worshipers are fond of this deity and they are found here as it is their most favoured place. It is their firm belief that they will achieve mastery over the Yantric vidya by meditating in this temple.\\n\\nAmbubachi Mela is a major festival for Tantric worshippers hence there will be thousands of tantric devotees in that annual festival. The Manasha Puja is another annual celebration where majority of non-Tantric devotees gather in thousands. In Navaratri festival days Durga Puja is celebrated every year in the autumn. This is a five-day festival when thousands of devotees from all over India flock around the temple for the holy darshan of the Goddess Kamakhya.\\n\\nThe Name 'Kamakhya\\u2019 has a mythological back ground. Lord Kamadeva, the love god, had lost his masculine power on account of a curse. In this place he meditated and pleased the goddess and acquired k his power and got rid from the curse. As a mark of his gaining potency the deity was installed and worshipped by him as such she came to be called as 'Kamakhya' Devi. The other story is that Shiva and Sati had their romantic encounters in this place. The word 'kama' in Sanskrit stands for love or lust and that is also a cause of action for the name \\u2018Kamakhya. In Hindi \\u2018Kama\\u2019 means love \\u2018kya\\u2019 means \\u2018what\\u2019 a question mark?\\n\\nOne other miracle (rather said to be a divine miracle) of the mother Goddess is that She bleeds during Ashada (June-July), which is attributed to be the menstruation. The blood joins the river Brahmaputra as a result the river turns red in the area of Kamakhya. Her temple is kept closed for three days. You may call it a story or myth. According to some, the priests pour vermilion into the waters to make it appear a symbolic menstruation. I had been to a Bhagavathi temple in Kerala where such a miracle is attributed to Goddess Bhagavathi.\\n\\nLast but another important aspect of this shrine is the tree with hundreds of bells of different sizes. It is believed that by tying a bell to this tree with a sincere prayer seeking any boon from the Goddess it will be fulfilled. Bells are available there itself. When you go there tie a bell to this holy tree with a prayer. Who known by the time you return home your request might get sanctioned. May Mother Goddess bless us all.\\n\\nGuwahati is the capital city of the State of Assam. It is well connected with buses from all parts of Assam as well as from other neighbouring States.

One can have it up to the last store when necessary. SBI is located on the hills.The deity is widely known as Kamakhya. According to Kalika Purana, Kamakhya (Yoni khand) is one of the FOUR primary Sakthi peethas; other three being VIMALA Temple (Pada khand) in the Jagannath temple complex, Puri, Odisha; TARA TARINI (Breast khand) near Brahmapur, Odisha and KALIKA at Kalighat (Mukha khand), Kolkata. This is also one of the 18 Sakthi Peethas. This is specially important for Tantric worshippers.Here the Garbhagriha (inner sanctum) is below ground level and consists of no image but a rock fissure in the shape of yoni.  This hollow is constantly filled with water from an underground perineal spring.  It is this vulva shaped depression that is worshipped as Kamakhya herself.  A \\u2018meru\\u2019 decorated with flowers is placed on the depression and devotees reaching this small and dark garbhagriha by narrow steps are allowed to touch this and are given the Teertha (Angodaka) by the priest.

The part that fell here were her Genitalia parts hence the name \\\"Kama - Akhya\\\". The temple closes by 5pm ( Pretty much most temples do as a matter of fact.... in the North East Sun sets early - I went in December and by 5:30PM it was practically pitch dark)\",\"We visited this great 9th century temple on 8th November 2017 on the last leg of our North East tour. Having heard lots of mysterious stories about Devi Kamakhya temple we were very curious to come here and this was also our main purpose of the tour. The temple is dedicated  to Mother goddess Kali. The mythological story behind the establishment of the temple is that when Lord Shiva came to know that his wife Parvati had jumped into fire because of insult to her husband by her father, he got infuriated and started dancing with her body. Her body parts started falling here and there and those places became temples of goddess,  revered as Shakti Peeths (Sacred power centers). One of the part, the reproductive organ is believed to have fallen here and so Kamakhya Devi (after the name of Kamrup region) temple is rated as a very powerful shakti peeth and also visited by tantriks (mystics) from all over India who indulge in mysticism and sorcery also on some particular day. Probably, this is the only temple in India where sacrifice of goats is still done on some occasions to fulfill one's desire. What I liked most about the temple is its cleanliness and good maintenance besides location on a hillock overlooking the city of Guwahati. We were advised to avoid Tuesdays, and weekends because of heavy rush and so visited it on Wednesday. Even then there were many people and it took us about 2 hours to have darshan without payment. By paying 500/- we could have completed the visit in just 1 hour without waiting in line. The payment could probably be useful on heavily crowded days. The other great attraction of this temple is that the priests do not harass you by asking extra money and whatever one feels like donating he can put it in hundis (lockers) kept at many places in the temple. We had great contented feeling after completing the temple visit. The whole temple campus is superb and outside there are many restaurants and shops selling religious items, sweets etc. A Must visit temple for all Hindus and even for non-Hindus because of its great location and surroundings.

It was probably an ancient Khasi sacrificial site, sacrifices are still very much part of worship here. Group of devotees arrive each morning with goats to offer to Shakti. Although little is known about the early history of the temple, the first reference to the place has been traced back to the Allahabad inscriptions of Emperor Samudragupta.\\n\\nThere is a legend attached to the history of the temple, which goes way back to the mythological age. According to the legend, Sati the wife of Lord Shiva (one of the holy Trinities in Hindu mythology) took her life at a `Yagna` ceremony that had been organized by her father Daksha, because she could not bear the insults hurled at her husband by her father. On hearing the news of his wife`s death, Shiva, the destroyer of all that was evil flew into a rage and punished Daksha by replacing his head with that of a goat. Torn between misery and blind fury, Shiva picked up the corpse of his beloved wife Sati and performed a dance of destruction called the `Tandava`.\\n\\nThe Kalika Purana, an ancient work in Sanskrit describes Kamakhya as the yielder of all desires, the young bride of Shiva, and the giver of salvation. Shakti is known as Kamakhya. The Kamakhya Temple, which is situated high up on a hill called Neelachal Parbat or Kamagiri in the city of Guwahati, is one of its several religious landmarks, which speaks volumes about the rich historical treasure over which the state of Assam is settled. This sacred temple in the heart of the capital city of Assam holds more than it meets the eye of the spectator. The Kamakhya Temple had been built in admiration to Goddess Kamakhya or Sati, who was one of the numerous incarnations of Goddess Durga or Goddess Shakti.\",\"This temple is one of the oldest fifty one Shakti Peethas in India. This is where the womb and vagina of Sati fell when Lord Vishnu cut Her body into 108 pieces which fell in different places and became sacred Shakti Peethams. Lord Kamadeva worshipped Kamakhya Devi (also called Tripura Sundaridevi) to regain his virility. According to another legend Brahma was challenged by Shakti when he became arrogant and cursed him that He could thereafter create only with the blessings of Her Yoni, the sole creative principle. After much penance Brahma brought a bright light of heaven and placed it within the Yoni circle which was created by Goddess and placed it at Kamarupa\\u2019s Kamkhya\\u2019s temple. She is regarded as an incarnation of Kali in KalikaPurana composed in 10th century.\\n\\nSituated at a height of 561 feet above on Nilachal hill, this temple attracts many devotees from all over the country. On this hill only, one can see separate shrines for Tantric goddesses called DasaMahavidyas like Kali, Tara, Buvaneshwari,Bhagalamukhi, Bhairavi,Chinnamasta,Dhumavathi and Shodashi. Inside the main shrine, Tripura Sundari,Matangi and Kamala reside.\\nOne can travel by taxi or auto to reach the uphill. From there one has to climb a few steps to reach the main temple. On the way one can see a row of shops selling pooja material. The narrow lanes remind us the lanes in Benares leading o KashiVishwanth temple. One has to descend a flight of steps as the main temple is at a lower level. A temple pond (SauvagyaKund) is seen. A few small shrines are seen there. Near the main shrine one can see two huge lion idols with many carved figures of gods and goddesses on the outer walls of the temple tower. The temple tower is in the shape of a hemispherical dome with seven oval spires topped by three golden pitchers or Kumbhas. The inner temple is below ground level. One has to wait patiently for hours to get darshan here. Otherwise one can buy special darshan ticket for 501/- and get darshan within one hour. The pandas here demand hefty amount and so one should be cautious while negotiating with them. But there is no hurried pushing of crowds in the queues. The devotees are permitted to go in a line in an orderly way. Near the darshan queue, there is a separate place where animals and birds are sacrificed. Generally goats, hens, ducks and pigeons are offered as sacrifice in morning hours. As we went in the afternoon we did not see any bloodshed or dead animals there.\\n\\nThe temple has three chambers with a narrow corridor. In the outer chamber one can see the metal idols of the Goddess and Lord Shiva draped in silk clothes and decorated with flowers. The devotees offer pooja material here and touch the holy water near these idols and sprinkle it on their heads. In the middle chamber there is a cave which leads to a natural underground spring that comes from a fissure in the rock. This is the Shakti peetham of Kamakhya where the goddess is seen as a 10-inch deep depression shaped in the form of yoni or female genital organ. Devotees sprinkle water form this deep fissure over their heads. On the walls in the cave one can see the sculptures of Ganesha, gods and goddesses. The idols are covered with silk clothes and smeared with heaps of kumkum and one cannot see the idols clearly. Not only here but in other temples also, the idols are not cleanly maintained. The shrines are very small and way is dark and so one cannot see the idols properly. No boards are kept to give information about those idols also.\\n\\nAccording to legends this temple was first built by Narakasura and later by the kings of Mleccha dynasty in 8thand 9th century. Later it was destroyed by Hussein Sha, a Muslim ruler. The ruins of the temple were discovered by Viswasingha, the founder of the Koch dynasty who revived the temple as a site of worship. His son, Nara Narayan (1540-1587) reconstructed this temple in 1565. In 1658 the kingdom of Kamarupa came under the rule of Ahom kings who further improved the temple. During the rule of SibaSingha, son of RudraSingha,the mangamentof the temple was handed over to toKrishnaram Bhattacharya, a Shaktamahant of Bengal. Even now the descendants of his family and his disciples (ParbatiyaGosains) act as priests. This temple was an ancient site of sacrificial place of Khasi people. That is why even now devotees sacrifice animals as offering to Goddess. Vajrayana, a type of mystic and tantric Buddhist sect, flourished in Kamakhya in 16th century.One can see the figures of Nara Narayan and Viswasingha on the temple walls. Just near the exit one can see a shrine for the Goddess Annapurna.This temple is regarded as the oldest place for Sakti cult and tantric worship. Even now one can see tantric monks around the temple premises. In and around this temple there are shrines for deities like for Kali, Tata, Bhuvaneswari, Durga, kedareswara, and gadadhara. As the sunset is very early at 5.00 p.m. we could not see all other temples. In these small shrines no priest is found and there is no light to see the idols in the shrine. People say that Bhuvaneswari temple is on the highest point of the hill at a height of 690 feet and one can have a panoramic view of the natural surroundings. Nearly two hundred people connected with temple duties reside on this hill. The temple opens at 8.00 a.m and closes at 5.00 p.m. So one should better come here early to have darshan.\\n\\nAt the donation counter also proper administration is lacking. For donors some Prasad and photos are to be given. During the month of June the Kamakhya temple is closed for three days when the waters of the river Brahmaputra turn red. People believe that the goddess menstruates during these days and so none is allowed to see Her. The cloth covering the idol also turns red. On this occasion lakhs of devotees attend the function called Ambhbachi Mela. Tantriks do special poojas during this time. During Nava Rathri five-day festival is observed.Many devotees buy \\u201cKamakhyaSindoor\\u201d made from a special type of rock and regard it as a blessing from the Goddess. This Shakti Peetham symbolizes the procreative powers of the Goddess.\",\"Situated atop Nilachal Hills in west Guwahati this temple is one of the most venerated of the 51 shakti pithas in India and it is dedicated to Goddess Kamkhya, an incarnation of Sati. The Mother Goddess is worshipped in Yoni form inside the sanctum sanctorum which is a cave with rock stairs. There is a large Q of devotees. We took a 501/- ticket and it took us nearly one hour to have darshan. A must see for the truly devoted...\",\"Visited this revered shrine in the Nilachal hill, near Guwahati, Assam on an evening in August 2019 . One of the four Mahashakthi peethas and one of the 51 Shakhipeethas, the temple is a must visit for the devotees.  Goddess of desire (Kamarupa) is worshiped at this 16th century temple and is an important shrine of Tantric worship. The tranquil surroundings are kept clean (could see the swatch Bharat scheme boards). Sculptor of Lord Ganapathy on one side of the outside panel of the temple is eye catching.  The place where animal sacrifices were done before had a live goat lying on the steps nearby, symbolically anointed with the red vermillion. The seven smaller individual temples of the Mahavidhya forms  of  goddess and three forms including Tripura Sundari inside the main temple were inspiring. We could not view the inner sanctum which is below ground level, as it was late in the evening. Would love to visit again, though it is supposedly very crowded during daytime.\",\"The Kamakhya temple is admittedly one of the most famous pilgrimage spots of Assam. Legend has it that when the discuss of Lord Vishnu cut into pieces the corpse of Sati, her genitals (yoni) fell on the sacred hilltop of Nilachal, and this place is one of the major Shakti peeths of India.The two main aspects of  pilgrimage to Kamakhya that are generally unknown to the casual tourists are : 1. The Goddess Kamakhya is worshipped in the sanctum sanctorium as a 'yoni' shaped rock in an underground cave below the temple, from which a perennial stream rises; there is no image of worship. The cave is narrow and only limited number of visitors can have 'Darshan', hence the maximum numbers are lead to the upper hall of the temple and shown a beautiful statue of the goddess which is reverred as the 'Dhyan -murti' or the form to be meditated on. However ,if one is intent of having a 'darshan' of the actual peetha, then one must arrive at the temple at sunrise and join an already serpentine queue on the right side of the temple. The gates of the underground shrine open after puja around 8am, and then the pilgrims proceed slowly into a narrow claustrophobic iron grilled enclosure (custom made for stampedes), winding at snails pace lower and lower , beyond ornate gates into a dark cave, lit by lamps where one can see the narrow rock pool with the flowing stream, which is worshipped as the living Goddess Kamakhya.2. Kameshwar/ Umananda Shiva is not to be seen on Nilachal hill, but resides instead in a little island on the Brahmaputra, known as Bhasmachal , where he is said to have burnt Kamdeva into ashes. The scenic river island can be seen from the Nilachal hill and small country boats ferry people across from the foot of Nilachal. Mind you, the pilgrimage to Kamakhya is considered incomplete unless you have worshipped her consort too at Bhasmachal.     Besides that the ancient temple complex has the usual attractions, sadhus, tantrics and yoginis with dreadlocks and trishuls of varying length and ferocity, shops selling 'Dakshinavarti shankas' and other esoteric goods used in Shakti and tantra worship, and many temples to the various aspects of the Goddess, some closed, some in use. The nature lover will enjoy the serpentine road climbing to the windy hilltop and the amazing views of the Brahmaputra,Guwahati and Saraighat bridge from there. History buffs can see many layers of architecture and styles, many statues some in worship , some defaced , a few half burried in the pavement.Unfortunately as a shrine in current worship not enough attention has been paid to preserve the ancient heritage during current rennovations.  While the Ambubachi festival is very famous , it is to be noted that the temple remains closed during the three days when the Goddess is said to be menstruating. Tantrics, yogis, bauls from all over gather in the temple yard and their songs, trances and dances gives the area a festive atmosphere. After the temple reopens, pieces of red cloth, said to have been steeped in the holy blood are distributed as 'prasad' and are valued as remedies and protection from various ills.\",\"Kamakhya temple is located on the top of Nilanchal hill which is located about 8 kilometres away from the city center.  The temple is dedicated to Goddess Shakti. It's a Shakti peeth. The female organ of Devi Sati had fallen here when her body was cut into 52 pieces by Lord Vishnu's chakra.  The temple and the city is send to have been founded by Kamdev and hence the name Kamrupa and Kamakhya.  The temple was crowded during our visit in the morning around 11 am. We took a hundred rupee ticket and still the darshan took 2 hours. The priests are very commercial here and keep expecting money. Hence need to be careful.\",\"Kamakhya Temple is one of the 52 Shakti Peethas, highly revered in Hinduism.  This temple is located on Nilachal Hill in the western part of Guwahati City.  Kamakhya is a manifestation of Maa Shakti - the supreme female deity as per Hindu Cult.  The temple atop the Hill can be reached via taxis or jeeps available downhill.  The road uphill is beautiful and from the top of the hill where the temple is located one gets to see a bird's eye view of the city of Guwahati and River Brahmaputra.  In the premises of the temple, there are multiple shops selling prasad, flower and pictures of various Gods and Goddesses.  The prasad commonly offered to the Goddess here is sugar coated gram.  We reached the premises around 11 am and since the queue by that time was already long, we decided to buy a Darshan ticket. Even though we were in the special darshan queue, it took one hour for us to reach the inner sanctum of the temple. The sanctum has a naturally-formed stone Yoni which represents Maa Kamakhya and is worshipped by putting flowers and sindoor on it.  The Yoni is constantly moistened with the sacred water flowing from a natural spring.  The darshan was peaceful and we felt revitalized.\",\"On the Temple Grounds of Guwahatii, in Assam_Land of Shakti, Ma Kamakhya is the apex of the cosmos. Of 64 Shakti Peeths, Ma Kamakhya_on the Nilachal (Blue) Hill is the Goddess Epicenter of India and hence the world. It was Vishnu's disc that saved the world from destruction. Shiva's mood, mourning the death of his beloved, was so dark so black, the Gods feared it would destroy the world. Vishnu's disc blitzed through the air, severing Shakti's corpse from Shiva's neck, slicing her body into 64 pieces, Scattering far and wide. This is where the Yoni fell! The most sacred part of Goddess' body.\\nKama=desire Akhya= the one who fulfills.\\n\\\"Divine Creatrix Mother, the fulfiller of desire\\\" is surrounded by smaller Temples of the Mahavedya's, Etheric Shrines of the 10 Wisdom Goddesses. The Temple grounds_a city unto it self, rich in treasure, like the Vatican. The priests are all men. A strange paradox. A living Tantric practice_expect the smell of blood and to stand in queues for hours to enter Ma Kamakhya's Sanctum Santorum.\",\"Kamakhya Temple is undoubtedly the greatest attraction in Guwahati. One of the holiest shrines of Maa Sati, the Adya Shakti. After the death of Sati in the Daksha Yajna, Lord Shiva became angry and after punishing Daksha with what he desreved, began to tour the world taking the body of Maa Sati on his shoulder. To calm him down, Lord Vishnu had to cut the holy body into pieces with his Shudarshana Chakra and the body parts got scattered over a large part. 52 such parts fell in different places and each one later became Shakti Peetha. One of the parts, her genital, fell here in Kamrup Kamakhya. People from all over India come here as pilgrims. Many foreigners also come to visit the place.\\n\\nIts a nice temple atop Nilachal Hill. Apart from the main temple, there are 10 other temples of the Dasa Maha Vidyas, Maa Sati's 10 different incarnations. At the top of the hill is the temple of Maa Bhubaneswari, one of the incarnations.\\n\\nApart from the religionistic angle, its also a beautiful place. The hill covered with dense forests in most places although urbanization has taken its share. The view of Guwahati city and the mighty Brahmaputra river from atop the hill is breathtaking. If you are a Hindu, you must visit it at least once in your life. If you are not, you must visit it at least once in your life for the serenity and beauty of the place.\",\"We went there out of the bloom, we had no plans at all. I guess it was destiny. Mataji calling, I loved it.\",\"Its an historical temple on hill top in heart of Guwahati City on the banks of Bramhaputra river. According to the Kalika Purana, Kamakhya Temple denotes the spot where Sati used to retire in secret to satisfy her amour with Shiva, and it was also the place where her yoni fell after Shiva danced with the corpse of Sati. Had wonderful view of Guahati City and river Bramhaputra\",\"This temple is the most revered temple in Assam and entire North East. On top of a hill with a view of beautiful surrounding hills and magical Brahmaputra, it is ethereally beautiful feeling to climb on the hill with sharp turns and speed restrictions. The view around is just beautiful.\\nWhen you reach the temple you find a massive queue for darshan of Ma Kamakhya. Those with better resources can pay for quicker darshan of the deity but really admirable is the devotion of those who stand in queue for hours to get the glimpse of the goddess.\\nThe legend goes back to Lord Shiva who danced with the dead body of his consort Sati and a part of her falling here on this hill and ever since this place being sacred to devotees of Lord Shiva and Ma Durga. This is most important center of Tantric and Shakti cult in this part of India.\\nGetting into the main sanctum which is in the form of a rock is an experience and I could feel the devotion of other visitors. The sight of religious priests and their acts sometime hold you back. So much money being offered and shown in front of the deity is an anachronistic feeling. What does currency notes have to do with the deity but people think differently. Priests and beggars pestering is an inconvenience one has to stoically but firmly bear.\\nGoing around the temple gives a good view of the temple structure, beautiful sculptures and religious fervour of the people. I deliberately avoided looking at the \\\"bali\\\" or sacrificial site, not convinced as to what killing of animals or birds has to do with religion and faith.

The crowd is frantic and transport was stopped. So we had to take help of taxis, which were also not available round the clock. Have seen some things which I thought would never see. We stayed on the hill, a km after Kamakhya temple entrance and had the opportunity for darshan during such hectic time of the year. Very lively and gotta admit the energy driving us when we were on the hill. Above all, according to Hindu scriptures, Goddess Sati's sex organs fell on this place when Siva carried her immolated body. Read the story before you go for comprehending the power of this place. This is considered the most important Shakti peetha of all. The darshan on a regular day would take nearly 3 hours. Plan accordingly\",\"The temple is also called Nilachal temple and consists of four chambers i.e. garbhagriha and three mandapas locally called calanta, pancharatna and natamandira aligned from east to west. The temple denotes the spot where Sati used to retire in secret to satisfy her amour with Shiva, and it was also the place where her yoni fell after Shiva danced with the corpse of Sati.

Suggest every one who visits Guwhati. Please Visit\",\"Hi everyone.I visited Kamakhya Temple in early July 2012. It was a partially researched trip due to the lack of exhaustive reviews covering practical aspects associated with the trip. I reached Guwahati a day earlier and stayed in Narangi. It is displaced from kamakhya by a decent distance and it took me about half an hour to reach. The traffic at Guwahati is fairly orderly by Assam standards but has a potential to intimidate you by the abundance of fly-overs and lack of sign-boards. What follows is my trip report covering all issues and practical problems faced by a devotee on the. 1.  WHEN TO VISIT.  The guidance provided by most websites/ blogs containing info about Kamakhya Temple is largely accurate. One should avoid periods of festivities, unless the trip is intended that way, to stay clear of unprecedented crowds and avoidable hassles. The place attracts huge number of devotees (lacs at times) during the annual ' Ambubachi Mela'- the days of the Great Goddess's annual mensturation- and becomes an epitome of a casual devotee's nightmare. The festival is celebrated in the month of June and is best avoided. Other occasions like the annual \\\"Manasha Puja', \\\"Durga Puja' and the Navratri may be included in one's caution-list on discretion. Periods of rain, as such, won\\u2019t pose much problem if you are equipped with a personal umbrella.  2.  TEMPLE TIMING.  The Kamakhya Devi official website states the following timings: Morning 8 to 1330. Afternoon 1430 to 1730 (Arti Time). The Temple `receives offerings from devotees in the form of 'animal sacrifice' everyday. The timings, as told by a local shopkeeper, are from morning to 1300 hrs. If you cannot stand the sight (which is in full view and indeed gruesome), avoid a morning darshan.  3.  WHERE TO STAY.  I stayed with the Army at Narangi so do not have much to say on this topic. Decent material is available on popular travel-booking websites to be consumed. The advice I'd like to offer is that if your trip is exclusively for the Darshan, stay close to the temple. Whatever little Guwahati has to offer (restaurants, attractions, shopping centres etc.) is close by then.4.  WHAT TO CARRY.  The climate is humid most of the year (except winter months). If visiting outside the cold months carry sufficient face towels and wear light and absorbent cotton clothes. The temple has an AC duct within the inner sanctum which is notorious for its lack of effectiveness and is often unserviceable. With the crowds it tends to be quiet hot and sweaty.   5.  HOW TO REACH.  The route to the Temple is serviced by shared Tata Sumo taxies and autos at expected rates. Private taxies are easily available from several taxi stands of from operators. 6.  THE ROUTE.  I shall talk about the climb only. It is about 4 km one way. The view of the city and the Brahmaputra is excellent and must be given its due time in your programme. Stop on the way up if you can, for the return may see you tired and unwilling. 7.  THE PARKING.  Unless you fall in the much celebrated VIP category (definition of which is as ambiguous as the art of serving the VIPs), head uphill from the barrier towards the right for the general parking lot. The VIP parking, nearer to the shrine by just a few metres, is overcrowded and requires superior parking skills.8.  THE 'PRASAD'.  The purchase of prasad is most convenient if done from shops located close to the shrine. This allows you to continue wearing your footwear for longer (the prasad shops would safe-keep them for free). I found the shops to be typical and the shopkeepers non-insistent. There is no facility for offering coconuts by traditional breaking within the temple, so we decided not to buy one. The sweets (peda, burfi etc.), as brought out by an unusually honest shopkeeper, are made mainly from sugar and powdered milk. We refrained from buying them. 9.  CARRIAGE OF MOBILES ETC.   The temple complex has signs showing restriction on the use of mobiles and cameras, but carrying of all possible accessories is allowed as there is practically no security check. Avoid items as dictated by common sense. 10.  THE TICKETS.  One of the factors which have barred Hinduism from having a healthy proliferation and have restricted it to fewer followers compared to other major religions is the way the practise of the faith has been manipulated by its (authorized??) handlers. 'Rule of the cash', as seen at other major Hindu shrines is seen here as well, though in a more systematic manner. The devotees are provided with the option of a quicker and more comfortable darshan by paying Rs 101 and 501 per person. Once in possession of the tickets, you are allotted a VIP gate for entry which takes you ahead of the swarming crowds (and makes you a VIP of sorts in their eyes!). If you subscribe to the practise of 'preferential treatment' based on money, and do not see this as a form of corruption, you can obtain the tickets with reasonable ease. When in possession of the tickets, ensure that you walk in your designated queue (there are few sign boards to educate you) or else you'll run the risk of losing the advantage you have gained over the common man. There is a provision of 'passes' for defence personnel (YES, the Temple Trust respects our soldiers and feels that they may be given a head start for the darshan in recognition of their sacrifices; NO, the passes are not entirely free. They cost Rs 10) at the same counters selling other tickets. These passes are not available during festivities. 11.  THE PANDAS (PRIESTS OF CONVENIENCE).  For all those who do not know what the topic means, a Panda (pronounced 'punda')is a priest of sorts who facilitates your communion with God by acting as a guide to various rituals and performs rites with you and on your behalf. So much for the original reason for the institution of the panda system. What the Pandas have degenerated to now is for everyone to see. The Pandas are anything but facilitators at most shrines these days. With no regard for humanity and absent basic-decency, they will arm-twist an unsuspecting devotee into coughing up money and gifts, all in the name of God. To me they are outstanding mood-spoilers. So much said, the Panda menace is, luckily, non-existent at the Kamakhya Temple. The association of Pandas has dished out pretty relentless rules and the members appeared eager to follow. The bottomline:  at Kamakhya Temple a Panda troubles you only if you want him to.12.  THE DARSHAN.  There is no idol of the Goddess in the Temple. What you are expected to do is touch the water and spend a moment of prayer when inside the inner sanctum. You can choose to take back the items of prasad with you (including the flowers and the cloth) or leave them at the service of the Devi. I felt the Darshan, barring the difficulty caused by the unserviceable AC, was quiet hassle free. 13.  TIME REQUIRED.  It took me close to two hrs from parking to parking. As per the locals, it was one of the leaner days. On days of full crowd, expect the time required to only rise. 14.  SUITABILITY FOR PEOPLE WITH LIMITATIONS ON WALKING/STANDING.  There is no facility or space to sit and rest once you are in the queue. The queue path is unsuitable for a wheelchair. People with difficulty in walking or standing should choose only the days of the leanest crowds. The weekdays have lesser crowd compared to weekends and holidays. 15.  FOOD.  Unlike many other shrines where a post-Darshan meal is readily available, the Kamakhya Temple appeared to be a little conservative. There are three shops near the VIP parking lot selling the usual snacks (South-Indian, punjabi, chaat etc.). There was apparently no supply of milk forcing the unscrupulous use of powdered milk for everything from sweets to tea.\",\"Any tourist who comes to Guwahati the city of temples must visit Kamakhya Temple, you feel nostalgic with its beauty and the spiritual environment.\",\"It was a very nice & mesmerizing tour of Guwahati while visiting to Kamakhya Devi temple with parents & family members.

You would most possibly feel happy at the end of the visit.\",\"If one is in Guwahati , he should definitely visit this temple and take blessings of Maa Kamakhya.Also you get to see nice vies from the hill top of the Guwahati city as well as beautiful Brahmaputra River\",\"If you are in Guwahati, Kamakya Temple is a must visit.
